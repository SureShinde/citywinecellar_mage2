"1";"2";"A trip through Italian Wine Regions";"trip-through-italian-wine-regions";"0";NULL;"<p>Italy is one of the oldest producers of wine.  There is probably not an inch of land across the whole country that you couldn’t grow grapes on and make a great wine.  Wine was made even before the Romans mass produced and brought modern storage techniques to wine making around 2 B.C. There are many regions across the country and in order to see the distinction between the many different wines, it is important to learn about the regions they come from.

There are many factors involved which make Italy one of the best wine producing countries.  Being surrounded by water makes for a great grape growing climate as well as the geographical topography with all the mountain ranges make for a variety of soil conditions. Italy is one of the world largest producer and consumers of wine. Italy’s twenty regions of wine are:
</p><p>Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Veneto, Trentino-Alto Adige, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Umbria, Marches, Latium, Abruzzi, Molise, Campania, Apulia, Basilicata, Calabria, Sicily, Sardinia.
</p><p>Aosta Valley is one of the smallest regions in Italy.  Located in the northwestern corner that borders Switzerland and France, this region has a very rocky and mountainous terrain. Some of the red wine regions include: Arnad-Montjovet, Efner d’Arvier, and Chambave.
</p><p>Piedmont has 52 Doc/Docg zones and is proud for having the largest percentage of it’s wines classified.  Some of the more popular red wines include Barolo, Barbaresco and Dolcetto.  Piedmonts white wines include Asti, and Moscato d’Asti.
</p><p>Liguria  has a rugged terrain which makes growing grapes a challenge and so their wines are limited but well worth trying to find with a distinctive taste.
</p><p>Lombardy is better known for consuming more than producing wine due to the numerous industries in this region.  The wines that come from Lombardy are actually very fine but often don’t get the recognition due to the import of neighboring wines.
</p><p>Veneto or otherwise known as Venice is not only beautiful but also on it’s way to becoming a large producer of classified wines.  Some of the wines produced in this region include Soave, Valpolicella and Bardolino.  Venice also produces other wines that fall under the IGT classification.
</p><p><u>Tentino</u> - Alto Adige is in the northernmost region.  The steep hillsides make it difficult to grow grapes and so more emphasis is concentrated on the quality of the wine.  To the north is an area named Sudtirol where the majority of the people speak German.
</p><p><u>Friuli</u> -Venezia Giulia has borders on Austria and Solvenia.  This regions produces some really good red wines and very distinctive white wines.
</p><p>Wine regions such as: Friuli Isonzo, and Friuli Aquileia are located here.
</p><p><u>Emilia </u>-Romagna is one of northern Italy’s eccentric regions with a different style all on it’s own. The wine from this region has a refreshing different quality from the wine from other regions.
</p><p><u>Tuscany</u> is the land of award winning wines such as Brunello and the Super Tuscans. Regarded as the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance, Tuscany gained famed for such wines like Chianti, and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano.
</p><p><u> Umbria</u> is the green heart of Italy famed for its white wines such as Orvieto. Located east of Tuscany and north of Rome, this region has green pastures.  Wines such as Falesco are found here.
</p><p><u> Le Marche</u> is a beautiful hilly wine region with miles of coastline.  The town of Urbino where Raphael the famous painter was born has rustic mountains and postcard picture perfect fishing villages like Portonovo. Coined the new Tuscany, Le Marche is home of wines like Verdicchio di Matelica and Verdicchio.
</p><p><u>Latium</u>  was once the center of the world.  Also known as Lazio, this region has fertile foothills and valleys.  Rome is located in Lazio and the region is known for wines such as Frascati, and Est! Est!! Est!!! di montefiascone. The soil has a volcanic history and is home to Malvasia and Trebbiano grapes.
</p><p><u>Abruzzi</u> is one-third hills and two thirds mountains was one of the first regions inhabited. Industrialized and produces the bulk of grapes which are used for blends.  Most grapes are shipped north to other regions for producing.  Montepulciano and Trebbiano are predominant but Abruzzi is gradually changing from bulk production to boutique production to make a quality product of their own.
</p><p><u>Molise</u> started gaining an official status in the early eighties.  Often overlooked for other regions, Molise has the potential to compete with its neighboring Abbruzzi and Campania.
</p><p><u>Campania</u> has a glorious past. From the Romans to the Greeks, praised the high quality wines of Campania.  From the volcanic soils near Vesuvius to the vineyards along the north coast, Campania has wines such as Anglianico, and Falanghina.
</p><p><u>Apulia</u> is home to dry well balanced red wines as well as white, sweet, and rose.  Geographically the heel of Italy’s symbolic boot, Apulia produced strong blends of wines.  Once nicknamed “Europe’s wine cellar” Apulia use to produce more wine than Sicily and Venice.
</p><p><u>Basilicata</u> has a cool climate for being located in the southern part of Italy.  Basilicata also known as Lucania produces wines that have intense flavors and nice aromas.  Wines such as Anglianico del Vulture is one wine Basilicata can be proud of.
</p><p><u> Calabria</u>  is a mountainous region that forms the toe on the boot of Italy.  Having a mixed climate produces two grape varieties such as Greco and Gaglioppo.  One of the more popular wines are Ciro.
</p><p><u> Sicily</u> is the largest island in the mediterranean.  Sicily produces Marsala, used in cooking.  Once possessing more vineyards than any other region, Sicily is now focusing more on quality than quantity. Sicily is home to wines such as Colossi Rosso, and many dessert wines.  A majority of the grapes are turned to raisins and used in local cooking.
</p><p><u>Sardinia</u> has a history influenced by many cultures.  Spaniards inhabited this isolated island.  Producing Moscato, Malvasia, Giro, Cannonau, and Vernaccia di Oristano, Sicily has ancient geological formations from the Palaeozoic era.
</p><p>I think every region of Italy is an endless adventure of taste and well worth exploring.  As always this is Billy Wineheart wishing you good food, good friends and good wine.

"2";"2";"What Makes a Wine a ""Best Seller""?";"best-seller-wines";"0";NULL;"<p>Ever wonder what constitutes a best selling wine?  Surprisingly not all of the best selling wines are all highly rated.  I believe many factors come into play when determining a best selling wine.  The economy sometimes has an effect on wine sales where people who were able to spend a few more dollars before may not have the money available now and so they choose a less expensive bottle.  </p><p>Sometimes the area of the stores location plays a part on what sells better than others.  For an example many people who live in the New York area may travel or have their best selling wine shipped from New Jersey or they may travel to a store that sells wine at wholesale prices.  I have been working in the industry for over six years and noticed that sometimes there are trends in the wines people purchase.  </p><p>Cavit Pinot Grigio is one of our best sellers because they have a great marketing team that advertises well.  Commercials and advertisement combined with reasonable pricing can make any item a best seller.  Some of the customers who come in our store enjoy our low prices and often wonder if we are selling wholesale.  </p><p>Some of the items that are best sellers include: J Lohr Cabernet Sauvignon, Franciscan Cabernet Sauvignon, Santa Margharita Pinot Grigio, Cavit Pinot Grigio, and Kendall Jackson Chardonnay.  Some of the best selling reds are: BV Tapestry, Ruffino Chianti, Marques de Caceres Rioja, and Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon. </p><p>Once in a while an article will come out with a particular wine and it might become a best seller for a short amount of time.  There are so many variables involved in determining best selling wines but check out a few that I listed and see for yourself.  </p><p>Another way to find out what is a best seller is to do some research and read some of the many publications out there that rate wine.  Wine Spectator sometimes have great articles on wine, producers, wineries, vineyards and even rate the vintages which are quite helpful.  </p><p>For instance 2007 was a great year for wine in California and so that any wine from the Napa, or Sonoma Valley that has a 2007 vintage, has a great possibility of being a great wine.  </p><p>You can also keep reading our blog posts, and while you are here check out some of the suggestions listed above as well as prices.  This is William Winehart as always wishing you good food, good friends and good wine. </p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"What Makes a Wine a Best Seller?";NULL;"​Ever wonder what constitutes a best selling wine?

I have heard of organic and this day in age more healthy conscious people are turning to organic foods and drinks, but biodynamic seemed to take it to the next level.  As I researched this concept I remember reading how a wine maker poured two glasses of the same wine, same grapes but just one was grown in biodynamic soil and the other regular soil.  The conclusion to that story was that 12 out of 13 people chose the biodynamic wine and commented that the taste was more vibrant and floral, clean and crisp as compared to the regular wine.  At that point the wine makers turn the whole vineyard over to the biodynamic method.</p><p><br></p><p>The concept of biodynamic is that the soil and the crop are both vital.  The calculations of harvesting and replanting are based on cosmic events.  The biodynamic farms also make their own compost and the rotation of different crops help the soil.  Some crops strip the soil of important minerals.  Crops such as potatoes and corn exhaust the soil while other crops such as clovers, peas and beans restore.  In bio dynamics the concept of rotating deep rooting with short rooting crops help maintain a great soil.  Many vineyards are changing into biodynamic.  Many benefits are in the taste but also the longevity of the wine.</p><p><br></p><p>Bio dynamics was discovered by a man named Dr. Rudolf Steiner after a group of farmers sought his advice.  Through research and lectures, he came up with the principles of biodynamic.  He later brought these concepts to America around 1930 and became more and more popular in present times.  Biodynamic wines are also considered to be 100 percent organic and there are many to choose from today. Look for my part two on the differences and more information on this topic.

"4";"2";"What's the difference between Champagne,Cava, Prosecco and other sparkling wines?";"champagne-cava-prosecco-differences";"0";NULL;"<p>Ever walk into your favorite liquor and wine store and looked at all the varieties of sparkling wine there are.  There are not only champagnes but also cavas, prosecco, spumante, and other sparkling wines to choose from.  I always wondered what's the best to toast with and what actually are the differences in all of them?  Let's start with the most known Champagne.</p><p>Champagne is a sparkling drink named after the town of Champagne located far north and close to Paris France.  To create the bubbles yeast and sugars are added which cause carbonation in the bottle.  If no sugars are added then the champagne is considered extra dry, if sugars are added then it is called brut.  Most people call all sparkling wines Champagnes but in fact it is not correct to call them all Champagne.  Most Champagne is made to drink right away and is considered a non vintage Champagne.  It will only last maybe three to four years before going flat and the grapes used are from many different vintages.  A vintaged Champagne can last up to fifteen years before going flat and the grapes are from one vintage.  The majority of grapes used to make champagne are chardonnay and pinot noir.  Some people say that the smaller the bubbles the better the champagne.  Champagne is best enjoyed in a long stem flute glass.  This design allows the flow of bubbles upward and enhances the aromas.  There are other methods of carbonation although the gas Co2 induced method creates larger bubbles.  Champagne first gained its popularity when used to annoint french kings and so the tradition of toasting on good occasions came to be.  It is a symbol of wealth and luxury.</p><p>Cava's are another sparkling wine which is made in the same process as champagne.  Originating from Spain from centuries old wine makers in the northern edge of Spain.  You can always tell if you're drinking a cava by the four pointed star on the cork.  It comes in all different types of sweetness as well and ninety-nine percent of cavas come from Spain. Cavas are generally aged from 18 to 24 months. Some of the most popular cavas is Freixenet and Codorniu.</p><p><span></span>Prosecco is another fine sparkling wine from Italy.  Although similar to the others mentioned it is actually made in a different method where they carbonate it in the tank before bottling.  This method is called the charmat method.  A prosecco that is extra sparkling is considered a spumante,not to be confused with asti-spumante ( a non champagne sparkling wine)which is sweeter. The lightly sparkling prosecco is named frizzante.  Many of the popular proseccos include Mionetto,and Riondo. Prosecco has a low alcohol content and the flavors are intense, fresh, and crisp. Very good for warm seasons and light as compared to champagne.  Italian prosecco falls under strict guidelines and is protected by DOGC.</p>The popularity of sparkling wines has grown and there are many non champagne types of sparkling wines out on the market.  Using different varieties of grapes there are now sparkling moscato and lightly fizzy vinho verdes like gazela  which are citrus flavored lightly sparkling wines.  So your next toast doesn't necessarily need a champagne when there are cava's and proseccos out there equally as good.";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"What's the difference between Champagne,Cava, Prosecco and other sparkling wines?";NULL;"Ever walk into your favorite liquor and wine store and looked at all the varieties of sparkling wine there are.

So many factors are involved in the making of the next great wine.  Weather, region, grapes and varietals as well as percentages of blending and age old techniques can come into play when making a great wine.  </p>
<p>Many try and just as many fail and it is kind of interesting to know that some of the wine you may be drinking may come from your favorite athlete or actor.  Some of these actors and athletes may acquire a vineyard for personal use while others invest hoping their recognition may boost sales.  I am not going to go against owning and it could be very lucrative.  Sales of celebrity supermarket wines are actually up 19%.</p>
<p>Some of our most popular owners who actually found success is Francis Ford Coppola who owns the historic Napa Valley winery Inglenook which he renamed Niebaum-Coppola.  </p>
<p>Rubicon is one of his better wines produced from his winery. </p>
<p>Dan Aykroyd owns his own winery in Ontario Canada and also produces some Sonoma county wines. </p>
<p>Antonio Banderas owns Anta Banderas In Ribera del Duero, Spain.  </p>
<p>Even Lorraine Bracco from the Sopranos owns Bracco Wines in Tuscany, Italy.  </p>
<p>Madonna, Dave Matthews, Arnold Palmer, Joe Montana and the list goes on.  </p>
<p>Did you know that even Robert Parker who rates wines for the Wine Advocate co-owns a winery with his brother-in law in Oregon and delegates the rating of Oregon wines to his associates due to the conflict of interest.  </p>
<p>It is very interesting to see who is involved, even Nancy Pelosi, former speaker of the house owns two vineyards.  Below is a list of some more that I compiled but I actually think it is kind of interesting to see that maybe that next glass of wine you drink may actually have been from your favorite actor.

Maybe it's the small quantaties produced but as Tequila grows more popular, there is a possibility you might meet it's cousin Mezcal.  Mezcal most likely will gain in popularity and might even surpass Tequila as the next best drink.</p><p>The origins of Mezcal is based in myth and is still a mystery.  Some say that lightning struck an agave plant and split it open to give birth to Mezcal the elixir of the gods.</p><p>Some say the spanish conquistadors ran out of their own liquor and after being introduced to agave, decided to distill it to createTequila and Mezcal.  Maybe some myths should stay mysteries because it adds a certain respect for the unknown.</p><p>Mezcal is made from the maguey plant which is a variety of agave.  The maguey plant was sacred in religious ceremonies and rituals of the Mexican culture.  Cooking the heart of the maguey and fermenting the juices was common.  The maguey plant takes some time to reach maturity and so only small quantaties of mezcal are made at a time.  There are many differences between Tequila and Mezcal.  Mezcal is a bit harsher and raw in taste compared to Tequlia which is smoother.  There are many different types of Mezcals and depending on distilling and aging, they all vary.  The smoky bite of Mezcal is like a single malt from Islay compared to a kentucky whiskey.  Originally Tequila and Mezcal was nick-named aguardiente or fiery water and was introduced to North America by the spanish conquistadors.</p><p>Mezcal is mostly made from the area of Oaxaca and starts by roasting the maguey which gives it the smoky flavor and taste.  The actual process takes about three days where the pinas` are cooked in a pit oven filled with hot rocks.  The underground roasting brings out the intensity of the flavor. The next step includes smashing and fermenting before distilling.  </p><p>Mezcal is usually enjoyed straight up and not mixed.  The smoky raw taste makes it a hard spirit to mix but I'm sure there will be a signature drink soon associated with Mezcal.  In Mexico, people take a shot in the morning before the day starts while others spill a little out to show respect to Mayahuel, the goddess of fertility and the maguey plant.  There are many diffferent brands of Mezcal but beware of the worm.  The concept of the worm in tequila and Mezcal was created in 1940 as a gimmick.  It's not even a real worm in the bottle, It's a larva and most of the bottles with the worm in it are lower quality products.  If a worm was inside the maguey plant then that would mean there was an infestation and the finished product would be of lower quality. </p><p>Mezcal may not be for everyone but it's definitely worth trying and who knows, maybe this spicy cousin of Tequila might be your next favorite drink.

"7";"2";"How do you like your Tequila?";"how-do-you-like-your-tequila";"0";NULL;"<p>Tequila is made in Mexico from the agave plant.  It got its name because it was primarily made in the surrounding area of the city Tequila and in the highlands.  It was first made in the 16th century but wasn't first recognized until 1656. The aztec people deserve the credit of discovering this drink but the spanish conquistadors after running out of brandy, distilled tequila as well and most likely introduced it to North America.  </p><p>The first tequila was actually mass produced in 1795 by José Maria Guadalupe de Cuervo and Don Cenobio Sauza was the first to export it to the United States and to a local bar near you.  After many years came different variations and different drinks were invented like one of summer's most popular margaritas.  There are many different types of tequila today. </p><p>Anejo,Reposado,Silver,Extra Anejo.  Let's break it down a little more:</p><p>Tequila  Silver, Platinum, Blanco , Plata , White  is un-aged, clear and is considered in it's purest form.  It has intense flavors of agave and a natural sweetness which is smooth(Suave). <br>Tequila Gold, Oro, Joven, Dark is actually the same as the Plata but with added flavorings and colors.  Among some of the popular tequilas like Cuervo you will find most bars and clubs use these young tequilas for mixed drinks and recipes.</p><p>Tequila Añejo (extra aged) is aged for at least one year in a barrel which darkens the tequila to an amber color. It's smoother and more complex as well as richer in taste. </p><p>Tequila Extra Añejo (ultra aged) is one of the newer classifications added to the family.  It is stored in barrels for more than three years which make the tequila even darker and more rich in color.  By governing laws, the aged tequila must be stored in barrels not exceeding 600 liters.</p><p>Tequilas are also governed under strict laws which puts them in two categories, 100% Blue agave and Mixed which must contain at least 51% agave and the rest could be cane sugars, coloring or sweeteners.  Among some of the most popular brands are Cuervo,Sauza,Patron,Don Julio, Cabo Wabo.  Some tequilas have added distilled water to reduce the alcohol content which can exceed 100 proof.</p>Hopefully the next time you grab the salt and lime for your tequila shot, you can impress your friends with some of this information. It not only is informative but makes a great party conversation.

Wine labels are very useful in explaining information on location, wineries, varietals, vintages and many other useful terms that can help any consumer in choosing a wine that is good for them.  Around 1983, new federal wine label requirements changed the minimum information that a label must contain before it hits the shelves.  Out of all the bottles of wine on the shelf, it is important to make sure your label stands out amongst the rest.  Unfortunately a beautiful label doesn’t mean it is a great wine but the information contained on the label might. Some pieces of information like vintage can be useful because wine varies year to year due to the weather conditions.  Wine labeling systems also protect not only the consumer but the producers as well.  Inaccurate information on a label is illegal and so labels enforce quality.</p><p>Some of the information you may find are:</p><ol><li>Name of Vineyard- This is optional information that vineyards may add because the property of the winery might produce high quality grapes.  Some vineyards might have the notoriety of producing great wines so they would most likely mention the vineyard on the label.</li><li>Vintage- The vintage is very important because wine differs year to year due to climatic changes.  There are charts that you can use to determine which year was the best in certain regions.</li><li>Region- Region or Appellation of Origen (AOC) explains region within certain states or geographical distinctions.  California laws require that 100% of the grapes come from within California.  Other states require at least 75% of the grapes come from that state.  When a label states a particular area like “Napa Valley” it means that 85 % of the grapes used come from that area.</li><li>Varietals- The varietal is the wine type. In 1983 the law stated that a varietal must contain at least 75% of the varietal listed.  100% varietal are not automatically better wines.  Some of the best wines have different percentages of different grapes.  Prior to 1983, the law required only 51% of the named varietal.</li><li>Alcohol Percentage- The alcohol percentage states the amount of alcohol the wine contains by volume.  This is a mandatory requirement for all wines.</li></ol><p>After 1988 they established a mandatory law to declare the amount of sulfites contained in the wine.  Wines which have levels above 10 parts per million of sulfur dioxide must be labeled.</p><p>They also established a law stating that any wine after 1989 must have a federal warning, like the warnings they put on cigarettes.</p><p>Some labels may include more information than others depending on the producers.  Some wineries have designers create new labels for them every year while others may continue using their original labels but that is all left up to the discretion of the producer.  Hopefully this article will help you in determining what wine is right for you.  Wine classification laws may differ from country to country.  Some wines may classify their wines by region only.

</p><p>Many people have difficulty reading wine labels from different regions. Knowing how to read the labels can be very beneficial for picking out a great wine.  Most of us, including myself sometimes buy wine based on the label, only to be disappointed by it’s contents.  Wine labels vary depending on the producer but all should contain the same information.  This is a basic guide and in some situations some information may be excluded or included.
</p><h2>Spanish wine laws and classification</h2><p> D.O. or Denominacion de Origen is a term assigned to Spanish wines and foods.  It is very similar to France and their A.O.C. (Appellation d’Origine Controlee).  It is a classification system which establishes and regulates the quality of Spanish wine.  The D.O. guarantees specific characteristics of geographical regions and no materials outside of that region will be permitted to be labeled.  This classification system helps protect vineyards and consumers.
</p><p>The D.O. is the mainstream grading system and there are about 120 regions that are classified under this system.  New sub groups were adopted in 1986.
</p><p> D.O.C. or Denominacion de Origen Calificada is determined by the national committee. They determine which D.O.s  are deserving for D.O.C. status.  These wines are usually follow strict requirements one of which is that the wine costs at least double that of the national average.
</p><p>In 2003 Spain revised the laws and sanctioned new categories which include:
</p><p>Vino de Calidad Producido en Region Determinada (VCPRD)
</p><p>Vinos de la Tierra (Vdlt) – These are considered the wines of the country.  This is one level above Vino de Mesa.
</p><p>Vino de Mesa – This wine is the lowest quality and considered table wine.
</p><p>They also created a category called D.O. Pago which applies to a single estate wine.  Pago means vineyard and this term applies to a wine that is wholly created and bottled in that region or area.
</p><h2>Aging Terms:</h2><p>Sometimes you may see a word like Reserva or Crianza on a Spanish wine label.  These words explain the age of the wine.  There are minimum requirements a wine must have to receive one of these terms.
</p><p>Joven: This term is for younger wine which is usually sold one year after harvest.
</p><p>Crianza: This wine is aged a minimum of two years with one year in a barrel.
</p><p>Reserva:  This wine is usually three years old and spends at least one year in the barrel.
</p><p>Gran Reserva:  This wine is five years old and spends two years in a barrel.
</p><p>These terms are observed by the DOC and the DO.  The Reservas and Gran Reservas of Spain represent some of the greatest valued wines in the world.
</p><p><br><br><br>
</p><h2>Reading the label:</h2><p>Name: This shows the name of the wine.
</p><p>Vintage: This shows the year of production.
</p><p>Bodega: The bodega is another term for winery.
</p><p>Region: The region is the location where the grapes have been grown.
</p><p>Alcohol Content: This shows the amount of alcohol in the wine.
</p><p>Size: This shows the size of the bottle.
</p><p>Sometimes the label might show the varietal which is the type of grape used to make the wine.  Some popular varietals include Garnacha, Albarino, Priorat, Malvasia, Viura,
</p><p>When you become familiar with the labels and understand the information on them, you will see that it isn’t as hard as you first thought.  Just the translation of a few words can help you in choosing a wine that is right for you.  Spain offers many different varietals and many of the wine producers in Spain believe that wine should be sold only when it is ready to drink.  This ideology and philosophy brings a passion to the winemakers in Spain to create something not only beautiful but enjoyable.

The reason why many of us stick to what we like and are wary to try something new mostly is because we have a hard time understanding the labels.  If you aren’t fluent in Italian, it might be difficult to understand an Italian wine label.  This article will hopefully give you some insight into understanding Italian wine labels.  Some labels may contain more information than others depending on the classification of the wine.  Italian wines fall under four classifications.  These classifications or regulations assure quality for wine and food products.  They are requirements that the label should contain certain pieces of information before distribution.</p><p>These Classifications are:</p><p>Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG)- This is the highest classification for traditional Italian wine.  It was established in 1963 and is designated for high quality wines.  The word garantita stands for guarantee.  Every wine that falls under the DOCG classification has gone through very strict government rules before distribution.  Each bottle has a numbered government seal across the neck.</p><p>Denominazione de Origine Controllata (DOC)- A majority of  the wine in Italy falls under this classification.  It is very similar to the French and their (AOC). The DOC and the DOCG place restrictions on the grape varieties, alcohol percentages and some of the processing techniques involved in the wines production.</p><p>Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT)- This classification was created around 1992 and is also known as the “Goria Law”. Named after the minister of agriculture, this classification covers all the wines that don’t fall the DOC and the DOGC. A possibility why these wines don’t fall under the other classifications may be because of the varietals used and so these wines are considered Vino da Tavolas (VDT).</p><p>Vino da Tavola (VDT)- This classification covers all wines considered table wines.  These wines do not follow the strict regulations.  Some quality wines do fall under this classification because they don’t follow traditional guidelines.</p><p>Super Tuscans- A super tuscan is an Italian wine that doesn’t follow traditional Italian wine making techniques.  They usually are a blend with grapes like Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot.  Some Super Tuscans are of high quality.</p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"How to read a wine label from Italy";NULL;"Many of us would like to try different wines from different countries.

A lot like deciphering hieroglyphics, French wine labels are a puzzle waiting to be solved.  I have gathered a few tips and references to help with choosing a good bottle of wine.  Knowing just a few of these simple terms can help in picking or recommending a great wine.
</p><p>It is important to understand that French wine doesn’t categorize their wines by the type of grape used.  So very rarely do you find a bottle labeled Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot.  The French labeling system usually indicates where the wine was produced or grown.
</p><h2>French wine laws and classifications.</h2><p>France has one of the oldest systems for protecting wine.  In 1935 there were various laws passed to control and protect the quality of French wine.  The Appellation d’Origine Controlee was established and other European systems are modeled after this system.  There are four categories in which French wine can fall under.  All regulated wine is required to label their bottles under one of these categories:
</p><p><b>Vin de table</b> – These wines are considered inferior and are usually cheap in price.  Most of these wines contain a variety of grapes grown in different places.  If the bottle is labeled Vin de table francaise, it means all the grapes were grown in France.  Even excellent wine can be labeled under this category if the wine contains many different types of grapes.
</p><p><b>Vin de pays</b> – This category is used to label wines that come from a specific area.  You can often find good quality wine at a low price under this category.  Vin de pays makes up about 20 percent of France’s wine production.  In order to separate itself from Vin de table, the wine must be submitted for tasting and analysis.  These wines also have to contain certain varieties or blends in order to fall under this category.
</p><p><b>Vin delimite de qualite superieure (VDQS)</b> – These wines adhere to strict standards and the wines under this category only make up a small part of France’s production.  This category should eventually be eliminated after 2011.
</p><p><b>Vin d’appellation d’origine controlee (AOC)</b> – This category indicates that the wine is strictly controlled.  Specific grapes, specific geographical area and specific standards are enforced to guarantee quality.  These wines make up about 30 percent of the market and are the most expensive out of all the categories.
</p><p>Every label of classification differs depending on which region the wine was made in. Another factor is that wines that fall under Vin de table and Vin de pays may contain less information than wines that fall under the higher classifications.
</p><h2>Varietals</h2><p>There are various types of grapes cultivated in France and due to strict regulation, there are no commonly found grape varieties planted throughout France.  Every variety is associated with a certain region.  Climate often dictates where certain varieties would appear to be favorable.  Cabernet Sauvignon wines are produced in Rhone, Rieslings in Loire.  By tradition many French wines are commonly blended from several grape varieties.
</p><h2>Terroir</h2><p>  Many factors are associated with Terroir which refers to a combination of factors associated with a vineyard.  Some of these factors are unique and may include:
</p><p>Soil, altitude, climate (wind, rainfall, elevation, etc.) are factors which differentiates each vineyard.  Terroir explains that even in the same region, no two grape varieties produce the same results in the wine.

"12";"2";"Is that brandy from cognac?";"is-that-brandy-from-cognac";"0";NULL;"<p>Believe it or not, cognac is actually a variety of brandy.  I know as many of you, I too walked into a liquor store and wondered what is the difference between brandy and cognac.  To my surprise cognac is named after the town of Cognac in France. It lies south of Paris and north of the Bordeaux area.  </p>
<p>In order to call a product cognac it must first go through strict guidelines before it hits the shelf in your local area. Cognac should contain no additives or coloring and should be aged in oak casks.  It should be aged no less than two years before hitting the markets and should only be aged in a storage facility registered with the BNIC.  </p>
<p>The BNIC is a way to guarantee the age and origin of the cognac.  Even the distillers  and their dimensions are under strict guidelines.  Copper pot distills are the preference for making great cognacs.</p>
<p>Cognac is produced by double distilling white wines which weren't suitable to drink but great for distilling and was created at first to use up the waste materials from wine making and actually considered a poor mans drink.  Discovered around the 12th century, the spirit was found to mature in wooden casks.</p><p>Cognac producing regions should not be confused with the wine making regions of Champagne.</p><p>There are many different grades of cognac like XO,VSOP, and VS.</p><p>XO also known as Antique or Cordon Bleu Centeur stands for extra old and is stored in a cask for at least six years but many carry an age of 20 years and up.</p><p>VS or Very Special is stored for three to five years.  The youngest of the cognacs.</p><p>VSOP ,  short for Very special old pale, is stored in casks for four to five years and up. The casks are usually made from oak trees that are anywhere from sixty to one hundred years old which add distinctive flavors and coloring to the cognac.  Now the longer the cognac ages in the barrel, the better the cognac.  Aging stops as soon as it is bottled.  The color is the key to determine the age.  The lighter the color the younger the cognac while well aged cognac have a brilliant dark amber to it.</p><p>So to sum it all up Cognac is actually a high quality brandy.  The word brandy actually has it's origins from the Dutch and means burnt wine or the burning or boiling of the wine in order to distill it.  Unlike scotch and whiskeys made from grain and made year round, Brandy and cognac has a seasonal production. </p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"Is that brandy from cognac?";NULL;"Believe it or not, cognac is actually a variety of brandy.

"13";"2";"What is a ""Super Tuscan""?";"what-is-a-super-tuscan";"0";NULL;"<p>I remember one day while working my boss was on vacation and a woman approached me to ask a question.  She asked me what exactly is a ""Super Tuscan""?  I must admit that I heard the term once in a while and felt ashamed that i didn't have a good enough answer to give her.</p>
<p>Of course I Googled the term on one of the computers to see if I could help her but in all honesty being put on the spot really gave me the ambition to do some research so next time I would be prepared.  </p>
<p>She said she joined a wine club and that week everyone had to bring a Super Tuscan to try.  She really enjoyed the club because they didn't just drink the wine but they also discovered the history behind the wine.  </p>
<p>She had an arm full of papers with a list scribbled down in different inks, fortunately the store wasn't too busy that day and I got to help her find a good Super Tuscan at a reasonable price.  </p>
<p>Weeks later she came in to thank me and to tell me that she joined another club because all the people in the previous club didn't share the same ambition and that they just were showing off by buying the most expensive Super Tuscan they could find.  </p>
<p>She laughed and told me that mostly everyone bought the same wine except from hers of course and she took the spotlight at that wine tasting for bringing something different.</p>
<p>Well to explain what a Super Tuscan is you have to look at the history of Italy.  Italy is of course has one of the oldest wine making histories around.  The Greeks and other settlers like the Etruscans were making wine many years before the Romans took over.  </p>
<p>The Romans were among the first to organize and pioneer larger quantaties as well as barreling techniques. Thousands of years later Italy has become one of the largest producers of wine supplying almost one fifth of the worlds wine. I mean when you say the word Italian, you think wine (after pizza of course).  </p>
<p>Vineyards take up most of the land in Italy so it's no wonder why italian wines are delicious.  Because of all the vineyards and producers the italian government had to establish a law to protect and classify original formulated wines and to seperate superior wines.  Wines like barolo and chianti are among these and adhere to a strict government guideline which classify them. </p>
<p>I know you are probably asking yourself ""What Guidelines"".  Well in short the Italian government has four categories which wines fall into.  These guidelines  are (VDT),(IGT),(DOC), and (DOCG). </p>
<p>Unfortunately I will have to explain and break these down in another article but Super Tuscans fall under (IGT) and are becoming extremely popular in recent times.  Super Tuscans didn't always fall into that category and at first were labeled ""vino da tavola"" which means basic red table wine and were looked upon as an inferior wine until they inherited their own category.  </p>
<p>The reason why they are labeled Super Tuscan is because they aren't made in the traditional blending laws of the region.  Most Super Tuscans contain Cabernet or Merlot which aren't found in traditional italian wines.  </p>
<p>As to who made the first Super Tuscan, well your guess is as good as mine.  Some say in 1970 Piero Antinori made the first by adding bordeaux varietals to his wine which he decided to name after his vineyard the grapes were harvested called Tignanello.  </p>
<p>Others say his relatives gave him the idea and made Sassicaia before Tignanello.  I also read that in 1968 a gentleman named Azienda Agricola San Felice created the first Super Tuscan called Vigorello so as to who created it first is still debatable.  So next time you pick up a bottle and see Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon or Bordeaux blended with italian wine then you most likely are holding a Super Tuscan.  </p>
<p>Many years later we are now at our present time and there are many delicious Super Tuscans to choose from.  I hope my little research is informative and enjoyable as much as I enjoyed learning about Super Tuscans.  </p>
<p>I still see the women from time to time and enjoy her wine club experiences with her as well as not only recommending but being recommended some great wines.

"14";"2";"The meaning of St. Patricks Day";"the-meaning-of-st-patricks-day";"0";NULL;"<p>It's that time of the year when you see all the people wearing green and being friendly to everyone.  The smiles, the parade, the festivities are inticipated by many.  The history behind the famous holiday is unfortunately not known by many. St. Patricks Day is a traditional day for spiritual renewal.  Many attend mass offering prayers before the festivals and parades begin.
<br><br>
</p>
<h2>The Holiday</h2>
<p>St Patricks Day officially became a holiday in the United States on March 17 and is really a religious holiday celebrated and observed by the Roman Catholic Church.  The birth of this holiday was around the early 17th century and has grown to be a part of the Irish culture and celebrated throughout the world.  Many American cities have their own unique traditions.  In Chicago they die their river green, in seattle they paint their traffic stripe of their parade routes green.  Even the white house die it's fountain green in celebration.  Almost all American cities have parades and festivities but none are larger than New York City.  The big apple St Patricks Day parade is one of the largest parades in the world and also the oldest civilian parade.  Everyone from military, police groups, firefighters and politicians wear green and march down 5th Avenue.  The parade had drawn controversy for many years for it's exclusion of openly gay orginizations.
<br><br>
</p>
<h2>The Three Leaf Clover</h2>
<p>Many associated the three leaf clover with St. Patricks Day. It is even the national flower of Ireland.  The meaning of the three leaf clover is quite simple.  It is said that St. Patrick taught the pagans about the holy trinity.  Each leaf representing The Father, The Son and The Holy Ghost.
<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Driving the Snakes Out of Ireland</h2>
<p>St Patrick has been known for driving the snakes from Ireland.  This is true and there are no snakes in Ireland but mainly because the island has been seperated from the rest of the continent since the Ice Age.  The meaning of driving the snakes from Ireland is really a metaphore.  St Patricks was the patron saint who is credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland and prior to this the pagans of Ireland use to worship serpent symbols in their religion.  So when St Patrick brought christianity he drove out the snakes and serpent worship.
</p>
<p>What would St. Patrick's Day be without a crock a' gold or perhaps a wee leprechaun tugging at that frown on your face? So, with the light-heartedness of the season in mind, The Celtic Connection once again brings you some fun facts about St. Patrick's Day.
</p>
<p>As with Imbolg, Groundhog Day, Valentine's Day and Easter, St. Patrick's Day owes it deepest origins to the coming of spring. Arriving at 5:09 PDT on March 20, the vernal equinox is a date on which the sun's rays illuminate half the earth, with neither the North nor South Pole angled into the sun.
</p>
<p>Ever get confused about four-leaf clovers and three-leaf shamrocks? The four-leaf clover, which you might find now and then out in your lawn, represents the solar-worshipping invaders of Ireland, the Celts and their crowd.
</p>
<p>The shamrock refers to the importance of triplism to Ireland's indigenous tribes as well as the triple worship of the Goddess of Ireland Ana (also Aine and Dana) in her aspects of maid, mother and crone. The symbol was eventually written into the legend of St. Patrick to describe the Trinity.
</p>
<p>Speaking of St. Patrick, one of the enduring yarns of St. Patrick's Day involves the saint standing atop the Reek (Croagh Patrick) and ringing a bell that banishes the snakes of Ireland to the sea in a masterstroke of pest extermination.
</p>
<p>However, the land bridge that connected Ireland to Europe was swamped by the ocean sometime around 5800 BC which undoubtedly prevented any ophidian from wiggling its way to Ireland in the first place.
</p>
<p>But the snake is more than a simple prop to a patron saint. A quintessential symbol of fertility and renewal, the snake has long been associated with Goddess worship. The tale of the ""snake"" leaving Ireland illustrates a Christian longing for the eradication of the ancient and benevolent goddess worship that once dominated Ireland. Also, as the snake was a symbol associated with the Druid caste, its departure could also apply to the gradual dilution of druidic beliefs into the early Christian church.
</p>
<p>Green beer, green leprechauns, green hats - green everything on St. Patrick's Day. Green is the colour of Ireland, of mysterious deeds, of an awakening earth, of the mist that lies in the hollows foretelling the coming of spring, of the shoots whose green colour deepens as they stretch toward the sun. Green is a verdant countryside and the colour of the finest season of the year - it is no wonder that wearing a bit of it wards off bad luck!
</p>
<p>The shillelagh is brought to us by the Dagda, good god of the Tuatha de Dannan. Literally the ""staff of life"" the club had phallic abilities of mythic proportion as well as the ability to bring the dead to life.
</p>
<p>The crock of gold, beloved of the wee folk, has ancient origins as well. The Dagda, though possessed of a ""Cauldron of Abundance"" likely gained his magical pot from an earlier goddess such as Cerridwen, the Great Mother. The cauldron unites the four elements - fire, the green herbs of earth, water and air - to form the womb of the Goddess and surely there can be no richer vessel than that.
</p>
<p>Beloved of the Druids, Cerridwen's gold was the lore and knowledge of that priestly class. But the Druid's trafficked in more than wisdom and vanishing gold reminds us of the trade routes they governed on which Irish gold was carried from Ireland to Britain. Gone, but never forgotten, desired, but just out of reach.
</p>
<p>The leprechaun belongs to a wider realm of Otherworldly beings. Leprechauns are solitary and apparently always male. They are rather stuffy and when considered in their traditional, non-commercial form, can be quite foul-mouthed. Some of their attributes, like a red beard and quality leisure time spent on a toadstool seem to be borrowings from European or Germanic folklore. Nonetheless, their relatives, the fairy folk are all we have left of the old Gods, the Tuatha de Dannan, and we're proud to count them as friends.
</p>
<p>The saint for whom the day is named was born Magonus Sccatus. Kidnapped from southwestern Britain, he was made a slave in Ireland for six years. Upon his escape he returned to Britain and was later christened ""Patricus.""
</p>
<p>Late in life, around age 40, he capitulated to the inner voice that directed him to return to the land of his captivity. Upon returning to Ireland he joined the Christian missionary effort then in place and lived out his life there.
</p>
<p>The legends and lore of St. Patrick make good fables, but they bear no resemblance to the actual life and mission of Patricus. Meant to inspire, these florid stories of driving away hags and druids detract from the meaningful and still timely message to be found in a hard-lived life of deprivation, faith and conviction.
</p>
<p>Whether your fancy runs to shamrocks, the emergence of spring or the heroic life of a mortal man, St. Patrick's Day has something for everyone. Enjoy!

"15";"2";"The facts about the healthy ingredients in wine";"the-facts-about-the-healthy-ingredients-in-wine";"0";NULL;"<p>If you haven't been advised by your doctor than you have probably seen articles on the healthy ingredients in wine.  Many customers come in and tell me that their doctor tells them to start drinking one glass of wine a day for their health and yet it seems these doctors don't fully explain the reasons behind their prescriptions.</p>
<p>Hopefully I can break down the myths and facts for you and even recommend some good wines that may help.  First, one of the reasons we are just finding out about the effects of wine is because of the history our country holds.  The effects of prohibition and the ban of alcoholic beverages may have hindered the research and slowed the discovery of the fascinating ingredients of  Resveratrol and Quercetin.  </p>
<p>Resveratrol and Quercetin are found in the seeds and skins of grapes and are polyphenols.  You may also find it in other foods such as peanuts and blueberries and in dark red wines.  Unfortunately white wines don't have the same effect as red wines because the skins and seeds are usually green and Resveratrol is mostly found in dark grapes.</p>
<p>The benefits of Resveratrol and Quercetin are many.  Some say it is anti-aging and postpones alzheimers and parkinson disease as well as loss of memory.  It is also known to reduce inflammation and protects the cells in your brain as well as neuron pathways from damage.  Some studies even show the prevention of some cancers and heart disease.  Not only is it an antioxidant but it also purges the body of bad blood cells.  The reason many doctors tell you to drink wine is because wine reduces anxiety and tension and aids in digestion.</p>
<p>A Farmingham heart study in the 1970 showed that moderate wine drinkers had 50% fewer deaths from heart disease than non drinkers.  Did you also know that wine was actually safer to drink than water up until the 18th century.  These are some of the facts behind the healthy benefits of wine but there are a few things to remember when drinking wine.  </p>
<p>Many patients with a cardiac history might be on a once a day tylenol regimen for prevention of strokes but please note that the combination of acetaminophens and ethanol causes liver damage so it isn't wise to mix aspirin and wine.

Before the 1990's the origin of Super Tuscans was rooted from the restrictive DOC practices of the Chianti zone. Due to certain Regulations the producer could not use Chianti as a name on the wine labels. It would be classified as <em>vino da tavola </em>- Italys' lowest wine designation.
</p><p>Today, most super Tuscans use the legal appellation of IGT (Indicazione Geografica Tipica), which gives producers more flexibility than Chianti and other Tuscan DOCs and more prestige than <em>vino da tavola</em>. The wines tend to be modern, big and rich—and often carry a price tag of $100 or more a bottle.
</p><p>Many well known Super Tuscans are based on a ""Bordeaux-blend"", meaning a combination of grapes typical for Bordeaux (esp. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot). These grapes are not originally from the region, but imported and planted later. The climate in Tuscany has proven to be very good for these grapes. One of the first successful Super Tuscan based a ""Bourdeaux-blend"" was <em>Sassicaia</em>, by Tenuta San Guido.
</p><p>Super-Tuscan wines can range in taste from very good Chianti-like wines to Bordeaux-type or California Cabernet-type wines, depending on the varying amounts of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and so on, and their specific vineyard areas. <a href=""http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/newer-supertuscan-wines-of-italy.html#glossary-decanter"">Decant</a> young (less than ten years old) super-Tuscan wines two or three hours before serving.
</p><p>So what are Super Tuscan wine? Very simple - they are wines made in Tuscany that are very good to drink and that do not conform to one of the standard wine compositions - meaning the percentage of certain grapes used to make the wine.
</p><p>Here are a few Super Tuscan wines that I enjoy.

</p><p>I have also spent countless hours browsing through the many web pages from online stores that will ship wine.
</p><p>There are so many wines that are considered Top Rated Wines.  I think the first step in picking a great wine is to understand your palate and your preferences.  Some people like Old World Wines while others may like New World Wines.  For those of you who might be novices in wine, I will explain these terms to you.
</p><p>Old World Wines are considered wines from regions that have been making wine for a very long time.  These wines are usually made traditionally under strict government guidelines using particular varietals.
</p><p>Italian wines are considered Old World because some of these wines can be dated back many generations and made in the same traditional way.  These wines can also be described as a certain style or taste and or feeling that you experience when you drink this wine.
</p><p>For example some may enjoy a nice traditional Rhone style wine which describes an Old World wine from France that possesses certain characteristics.  Some of these Old World Wines come from France, Italy, Spain and European Regions.
</p><p>New World Wine refers to wines that are fairly new from up and coming regions that use new techniques or new varietals.  Some of these regions include: <br>
</p><ul>
	<li>The United States</li>
	<li>South Africa</li>
	<li>Australia</li>
	<li>Chile</li>
	<li>And others.</li>
</ul><p>These wines use different techniques and different blends that differ from traditional styles.  There have been some instances where a New World region can produce an Old world Varietal and the term isn’t confined to a region but refers more to the traditional or non traditional way a wine is produced.
</p><p>So once you find your style you can then explore the Top Rated wines from that region.
</p><p>I will try to list these top rated wines according to region to simplify your decision for that perfect wine.
</p><h2>Old World Wines:</h2><h3>Italian Wines:</h3><p>Some of the Top rated wines come from vineyards that have been making wine for a very long time.

Whether sold as Syrah or Shiraz, these wines enjoy great popularity.</p><p>Syrah is used as a varietal and is also blended. Following several years of strong planting, Syrah was estimated in 2004 to be the world's 7th most grown grape. </p><p>It is called Syrah in its country of origin, France, as well as in the rest of Europe, Argentina, Chile, New Zealand, Uruguay and most of the United States. </p><p>The name Shiraz became popular for this grape variety in Australia, where it has long been established as the most grown dark-skinned variety. In Australia it was also commonly called Hermitage up to the late 1980s, but since that name is also a French Protected designation of origin, this naming practice caused a problem in some export markets and was dropped. </p><p>The name Shiraz for this grape variety is also commonly used in South Africa and Canada.</p><p>Syrah continues to be the main grape of the Northern Rhône and is associated with classic wines such as Hermitage, Cornas and Côte-Rôtie. In the Southern Rhône it is used as a blending grape in such wines as Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Gigondas and Côtes du Rhône, where Grenache usually makes up the bulk of the blend. </p><p>Although its best incarnations will age for decades, less-extracted styles may be enjoyed young for their lively red and blueberry characters and smooth tannin structure. </p><p>Syrah has been widely used as a blending grape in the red wines of many countries due to its fleshy fruit mid-palate, balancing the weaknesses of other varieties and resulting in a ""complete"" wine.</p><p>From the 1970s and even more from the 1990s, Syrah has enjoyed increased popularity, and plantings of the variety has expanded significantly in both old and new locations. In the early 2000s, it broke into the top 10 of varieties planted worldwide for the first time.</p><p>Shiraz is known for its spicy blackberry, plum, and peppery flavors. </p><p>Often there are additional notes of licorice, bitter chocolate and mocha. Shiraz is even affected by growing temperature - warmer climates bring out the mellower flavors of plum, while cooler temperatures spice up the wine.</p><p>Shiraz can be made in a fruity style, which many ""sweet"" wine drinkers enjoy.

</p><p>I have noticed many times that some bottles may say such and such winery and others say such and such vineyard and that made me a little curious…
</p><p>...I really found it an intriguing detail and so I researched the differences between a Vineyard and Winery.
</p><h2>What is a Vineyard?</h2><p><img src=""https://theliquorstore.com/media/magpleasure/mpblog/upload/b/1/b1af59c0ac20364632635f891415b67d.jpg"" alt="""" width=""290"" height=""218"" style=""float: left; width: 290px; height: 218px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;"">
</p><p>I will start with a Vineyard.  A brief description of a vineyard is a farm, field or land where the grapes used to produce wine are grown. The land where the vines are planted and some of the characteristics of the wine are determined by the terrier or land and the minerals of the soil and climate.</p><p>Some vineyards are small while others are vast and some have gained popularity in different regions and became sort of famous for producing great wines. </p><p> Such regional areas include Napa Valley, Rioja, Mendoza Argentina, Tuscany Italy, Etc.  To be more descriptive, a vineyard is not necessarily the place where the wine is made.  Some vineyards are small and do not have the necessary means to make the wine so they ship out the grapes to a winery to make the wine. </p><p> If a bottle says it is from a vineyard then most likely they are responsible for both growing and production of the wine.</p><h2>What is a Winery?</h2><p><img src=""https://theliquorstore.com/media/magpleasure/mpblog/upload/9/e/9e4687aef18a322199c9eceb2ad9063d.jpg"" width=""279"" height=""212"" alt="""" style=""width: 279px; height: 212px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;""></p><p>A winery is responsible for the total creation and bottling of a wine.  Everything from de-stemming, crushing, fermentation and bottling are performed at the Winery. </p><p> Many of the bigger Vineyards and Wineries are at the same place.  Some Wineries solely use their own grapes while others may use the grapes from smaller vineyards to mix different varietals with. </p><p> Some of the more famous wineries are Robert Mondavi Winery, Rubicon Estate Wineries, Etc.
</p><p>So there is a difference between Vineyards and Wineries although a majority of Wineries are located on the vineyards they represent.</p><p><a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/types-of-red-wine.html"">Related Post: Types of Red Wine</a></p><p><a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/"">Explore more of our inventory here.</a></p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"What’s the difference between a Winery and a Vineyard?";NULL;"Many times as I browse the shelves of my favorite wine store, I have read many labels trying to see if the descriptions of the wine could satisfy my palate.

"21";"2";"What’s the difference between single malt scotch and other whiskies?";"single-malt-scotch-differences";"0";NULL;"<p>Single Malt Scotch means it comes from a single distillery and that it is made from a majority of malted barley unlike other whiskeys made from grain like maze (corn) or cereal blends.
</p><p>In order for a scotch to be named scotch it must be made in Scotland and barreled for at least three years.
</p><p>Single malt scotch is aged much longer which allows the flavors and bouquet to mature and is only made from one distillery and not mixed and carries the name of its origin.
</p><p>There are many differences between Scotch whiskey and Irish whiskey.  There are many types of whiskey but only around four different areas where they make scotch whiskey.
</p><p><b>These types are named:</b>
</p><ul>
	<li>Highland single malts</li>
	<li>Islay single malts</li>
	<li>Lowland single malts</li>
	<li>Speyburn</li>
</ul><p><b>Many highland single malt scotch includes brands like:</b>
</p><ul>
	<li>Clynelish single malt</li>
	<li>Oban single malt</li>
	<li>and Glenmorangie. </li>
</ul><p><b>Lowland single malts include brands like:</b>
</p><ul>
	<li>Glenkinchie single malt 10 yr</li>
	<li>Auchentoshan single malt 10 yr. </li>
</ul><p><b>Islay single malts consist of brands like:</b>
</p><ul>
	<li>Bowmore</li>
	<li>Laphroaig</li>
	<li>Ardbeg</li>
	<li>lagavulin.  </li>
</ul><p>Speyburn makes a  single malt which carries the same name Speyburn.
</p><p>Islays is known for their peaty smokey heavy taste while highlands are lighter.  Single malt scotches are considered more earthy and peaty because they add peat and smoke the barley before making the mash.
</p><p>Many people have different experiences with each but no matter what there is something different about scotch whiskeys as compared to other whiskeys.  Maybe it’s the Scotland waters or the air and climate but they all are great to experience.
</p><p>Now Irish whiskies differ from Scotland in technique and production. Whereas scotch single malts are pot still, Irish single malts are considered pure pot still.
</p><p>Most Irish whiskies are distilled three times and are considered smoother than the Scotch who distill twice and have more smokey overtones from the peat added.  Both the Scotch and the Irish are credited with bringing this spirit to North America.
</p><p>Beside single malt there is also vatted malt which is a blend from different distilleries.
</p><p>In America during the revolutionary war whiskey was used as currency.  Whiskey was eventually taxed and during prohibition many whiskey makers would distill at night to avoid getting arrested which led to the practice of making moonshine.
</p><p>Moonshine contains the spirit that is used to make whiskey and is sometimes referred to as white lightning and was clear like water.  Moonshine contained a  higher alcohol content and was rumored to quench even the devils thirst.
</p><p>In Scotland they pronounce the drink as whisky as compared to Irish and America who pronounce it as whiskey.  Canadian Whiskey is different as they use a majority of rye in their mash which makes for a lighter smoother whiskey.
</p><p>In order to be classified as a Canadian whiskey it must be aged for three years in wooden casks.  It is not dictated that Canadian whiskey contain rye but a majority of Canadian whiskeys do.

</p><p>You can Google it but the amount of answers you may receive may make you <em>more confused</em> than when you first asked your question.
</p><p>To pair wine with pizza is not as simple as you think...
</p><p>...There are many wines with different characteristics as there are pizzas with different styles.
</p><p>You have to first find out what kind of pizza you may be eating.
</p><ul>
	<li>What toppings?  </li>
	<li>What kind of sauce? </li>
</ul><p>Once you have the menu down than you can choose the right wine that will complement the pizza.
</p><p>I am a lover of all different types of pizza and think that it has to have been one of the best creations ever made (next to hot dogs of course…).
</p><p>Many people like myself at one time thought that all Italian wines go well with pizza but there are a few others that might surprise you.
</p><p>What if you were to get a non traditional pizza such as one topped with pineapples and ham, then you would want to try a Riesling or a sweeter wine to complement the pineapples.
</p><p>If your pizza had onions and mushrooms then I would suggest maybe a Chardonnay to pair with the sweetness of the onions.
</p><p>If you are a meat lover and want to put sausage and pepperoni than you might want to consider a nice Sangiovese or a Montepulciano from Italy or even a Pinot Noir to pair with the meat. It will not overpower the pizza and complements the mushrooms to bring out the earthiness of the taste.
</p><p>I think one of the things or rules you should always consider is to not pay more for the wine than the meal.
</p><p><u>Not all the pairings that you read may suit you.</u>
</p><p><b>Everyone’s palate is different and the best wine for you may not be the best for others.</b>
</p><p>Just writing about all of this is actually making me hungry.
</p><p>So next time you have a pizza night for the family, try some of the suggestions and discover how wine can actually make food taste better.

</p><p>….They are all similar in color and although many may argue, most have similar textures and tastes.
</p><p>I walked into many liquor stores and asked but not too many were able to answer my question.
</p><p>After finally getting all the right answers at <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/"">TheLiquorStore.com</a> in Brooklyn, I can finally share them with you.
</p><p><b><em>Bourbon (whiskey)</em></b> </p><p>Made mostly in the U.S. from a  mash that is fermented and contains at least 51% corn.  It must contain no more than 160 proof and be aged in new charred oak barrels for at least 2 years.  Kentucky is known to make great bourbon due to the water which is hard and contains limestone.(examples:  Maker's Mark, Jim Beam, Old Grandad)  Named Bourbon from the area it's created. (Bourbon Kentucky)
</p><p><b><em>Scotch (single malt)</em></b> </p><p> Originated in Scotland. Single Malts are made from malted barley and are the product of a single distillery. Scotch is fermented from a mash of malted barley. In Scotland they call it Whisky unlike in Ireland they consider it Whiskey.
</p><p><b><em>Blended scotch (whiskey)</em></b> </p><p>are a mixture of several different malt whiskies (blend of grains), or known as a sour mash plus grain alcohol.
</p><p><b><em>Whiskey (Tennessee)</em></b> </p><p>Made in Tennessee from a mash containing at least 51% corn, then filtered through charcoal before aging. The charcoal makes the whiskey smooth   (examples:  Jack Daniel's, Dickel)
</p><p><b><em>Canadian Whiskey</em></b> </p><p>Made with large quantities of rye and considered smoother.
</p><p><b><em>Irish Whiskey</em></b> </p><p>Is distilled continuously from malted and un-malted barley and other grains. Grain whiskey is lighter, smoother and neutral compared to Irish single malts.  Irish single malts are distilled in a pot still and are made from 100% barley.  Irish whiskey is one of the earliest distilled drinks made in Europe.
</p><p>The key to making a great whiskey is in the water.  Kentucky and Tennessee have great hard limestone water which helps in the fermenting process where once the grain and the water reach their boiling point, the sugars are released and the alcohol turns to vapor to be distilled back into liquid form which is the spirit needed to create the whiskey.</p><p>Usually clear   until added to the barrel where the spirit absorbs a lot of the flavors in the wood which add a caramel, vanilla and other hints of flavors which texture the spirit and turn it into America’s favorite drink.  Please check out City Wine Cellar for their great prices and great customer service. Well until next time ,this is Billy Wineheart wishing you good food, good company and good spirits for life.

</p><p><b><u>In the end it is what your taste buds like.</u></b>
</p><p>Some tend to compliment spices and flavors where others tend to counter them in contrast with opposing flavors.  I suggest exploring with different wines until you find your style.
</p><p>White wines are light and work very well with light dishes.  They range from oaky to sweet and everything in between.
</p><p>Wines were always served with food and at times were safer to drink than the water.  Over the years as the dishes and recipes grew so did the winemaking techniques and so became the art of food pairing.
</p><h2>Chardonnay</h2><p>This green grape is commonly known to have such flavors as terroir and oak.  Sometimes buttery, it is an important component for Champagnes and sparkling wines.  Chardonnay can pair with a wide selection of foods but goes well with poultry, cheeses, pineapples and white cream sauces. Even smoked fishes work well with Chardonnay.
</p><h2>Sauvignon Blanc</h2><p>This grape sometimes known as fume blanc has dry and citrus characteristics to it.  Typically light to medium bodied ,this wine has acidity and so it works well with vegetable dishes, salads, sushi, Thai foods, and light poultry.  Please note that some Sauvignon Blanc’s have more lemony flavors while others have more earth and mineral tones.  Read the labels and experiment.  Oyster lovers swear by this wine.
</p><h2>Pinot Grigio</h2><p>Sometimes referred to as Pinot Gris, this wine is dry and light.  Usually opened at the start of a meal it is Italy’s most popular white wine.  Great with cheeses and light pasta dishes with white cream sauces, the high acidity makes it disagree with highly acidic foods like lemons or tomatoes.
</p><h2>Moscato</h2><p>Muscatel or Muscat d’asti loves to pair with fruit dishes.  Very sweet, this grape varietal is used to make raisins.  Mostly found in sparkling wines, it works well with dessert,fruits and honey.  It does have lower alcohol than other white wines and is often consumed after the main course. Much sweeter than Riesling it is a delicious wine.
</p><h2>Riesling</h2><p>Mostly grown in colder regions, Rieslings have great aromas of apples and fruits.  This grape is often used to make a semi sweet wine.  The natural high acidity makes Riesling is capable of aging but often consumed young.  It goes well with spicy foods, Chinese, Thai, Pork, etc.
</p><p>Of course there are white wines from other countries not mentioned here like white Bordeaux’s, Vino Verde, and Chablis which you can fit into one of the categories above due to the texture and body of these wines.
</p><p>Don’t get absorbed with the pairings and make sure you have fun with it.  Explore and find your combo.  Please feel free to add your comments or food pairings with us and again I thank you on behalf of the staff.  This is William Wineheart wishing you good food, good friends and good wine. Enjoy

"25";"2";"Red Wine Food Pairing: Basics, Examples, & Tips";"red-wine-and-food-pairings";"0";NULL;"<p>One of the most often asked questions in a wine store is about what wine pairs with what food.
</p><p>Although it isn’t an exact science, there are some facts that might help you.  I know most people have a favorite wine and they drink it with whatever dish but if you want to impress or even surprise your palate once in a while then please read on.
</p><p><b>It all starts with the menu.</b>
</p><p>Certain foods contain certain characteristics whether it is a dominating flavor or spice.  Grilled chicken or a smoked salmon has an oaky wood smoke taste so in turn you would want a wine to compliment the flavor to enhance your experience.
</p><p>Every wine like every food has its own uniqueness to it as well as every persons taste buds are different and I always encourage experimenting.  Food and wine pairings aren’t always set in stone so try different combinations until you find one you like.
</p><p>If you are just starting out then below are some guidelines.  You should always remember to drink light wines to dark.  It’s not normal to serve a red wine with an appetizer.  Please keep in mind that you pair what is best for you and don’t get caught up in other people’s opinions.
</p><p>Red wines range from light bodied to heavy bodied.  They contain more tannins than white wines and some are more acidic than others.  The light bodied wines have less tannins and feel light, like water in the mouth as compared to the heavier wines which make you pucker and feel heavy in the mouth like milk.  The more tannins present in the wine the heavier and more astringent the wine will be. Let’s start out with the lighter red wines.
</p><h2>Pinot Noirs</h2><p>These are light, velvety and pretty versatile when pairing with food.  It is one of the few red wines that gives white wine a run for it’s money by breaking the rule of all red wines go with meat and all white wines go with seafood.  Pinot noirs are more acidic or tart and pair well with lean meats and vegetables like poultry, lamb, pork and fish.  The light delicate tartness of the wine help compliment lean cuts of meat and smoked fish.
</p><h2>Shiraz</h2><p>Also known as Syrah, are a light to medium bodied wine that has hints of spices, blackberry and violets. Syrah is an all occasion wine and pairs well with hamburgers, pizza and some grilled meats. Grilled tuna, sausage and ribs are also great foods that go along with syrah.
</p><h2>Zinfandel</h2><p>Zinfandel was originally used as a blending grape.  The wine has tastes of blackberry, boysenberry, raspberry and cherry with pepper overtones.  The alcohol contents range anywhere from 13% to 18% but the lower alcohol Zinfandel  pairs better with foods.  These wines pair very well with big foods like grilled ribs and cheeses. This wine is a great barbeque wine for foods like hamburgers or grilled steaks. Be wary about pairing with fish or lighter foods because this wine will overpower them.
</p><h2>Merlot</h2><p>Merlot is full bodied and robust with high levels of ripe tannins which can age for a long period of time. The diversity of Merlot makes it have a wide range of food pairings. Pasta with red sauce, grilled meats, mushrooms, beef stews, salads.  Merlot is very similar to Cabernet only less astringent and puckering. This is definitely a wine that goes with almost anything.
</p><h2>Cabernet Sauvignon</h2><p>Cabernet Sauvignon is a full bodied wine.  More puckering and astringent, this wine works very well with heavier foods such as steak, red meats, filet mignon and  bold strong cheeses.This wine doesn’t pair well with fish because the oils in the fish can make the wine taste more metallic.  Chocolate although hard to really pair with wine, does go well with Cabernet Sauvignon.
</p><h2>Other Wines to Look For</h2><p>Most of the wines I mentioned in this article are domestic and primarily consumed in North America but there are a few other reds I didn’t mention like Chianti, Sangiovese, Malbec, Bordeaux, etc.  These are regional wines found internationally and have similar characteristics to the wines mentioned above.
</p><p>This is part one of a two part series and hopefully I have broadened your understanding of food pairings.  With a little experimentation, anyone can become a professional and know which pairs work well.  When a wine is paired well you will know because the flavor of foods as well as wine is enhanced and compliment each other.  So as always this is William WineHeart wishing you good wine, good food, and good friends.  Please feel free to write me about your food pairing experiments.

"26";"2";"Selecting the Right Wine Store";"selecting-wine-store";"0";NULL;"<p>Finding a wine shop is not as easy as it sounds, because not all wine shops are created equally.
</p><p>I have been to many wine shops only to be disappointed by their selection of wines.  It reminds me of the three little bears where one bed was too hard, one was too soft and one was just right.
</p><p>Some stores concentrate more on their liquor sections and so you don’t find a great selection of wine, while others just buy the economical wine because it sells, but once in a while you will find a store with a great selection of wine and liquor.
</p><p>I mean, 30 year old scotch to really highly rated wines like Opus One, and Silver Oak.
</p><p><b>These shops are a rare find.</b>
</p><p>Many places in Manhattan that I have come across had too many high end wines and due to my budget sometimes I can’t splurge on the high end stuff.
</p><p>Another problem is the employees often do not have the knowledge of wine or have good recommendations for a good bottle.
</p><p>Most of the time I feel a little claustrophobic from the small isles and cramped shelves hoping to find a diamond amongst a hill of glass.  I wasn’t always a big fan of wine and spent most of my college days playing beer pong with shots of Soco and lime.
</p><p>I started working at <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/"">TheLiquorStore.com </a> and through the many years employed I have grown to love wine.  I have a new appreciation for the time and skill involved in making the next highly rated wine.
</p><p>I have explored my palate and got a feel for the odd words often found in wine publications.
</p><p>Words like Bouquet, Tannins, legs, and other odd words that are used to describe wine.  As confusing as it may seem, it gradually becomes second hand and you will see as you develop your palate, the more you will be able to pair your wine with food and recommend great wines to others.
</p><p>I enjoy where I work and I think it is mostly the customers that make it enjoyable.  Everyday you learn something new.  I remember once a woman came in looking for a Super Tuscan for a tasting club she belonged to and wanted to know what one was.
</p><p>I recommended a great inexpensive Super Tuscan and she was a big hit because it seemed that all the people in her club all bought the same expensive bottle of wine.  People were delighted to know that you don’t have to spend your whole weekly paycheck to find a good Super Tuscan.
</p><p>I felt really good when she came back to thank me because and told me that her bottle went the fastest because everyone wanted to try something different.

"27";"2";"Green Spain- Galicia (Wine Region of Spain)";"galicia-wine-region-spain";"0";NULL;"<p>Green Spain or known to the Spanish as Espana Verde and is located in the northern region in Galicia.  It is called Green because it is exposed to the Atlantic Ocean and has a wet, moist climate.  The precipitation is much higher than in most of the other regions of Spain.  Reminiscent of Ireland, an immigrant colony of Celts influence the culture of the region.  The proximity of the region to Portugal to the south and the mountains to the north pretty much isolates Green Spain and so the wine from this region is largely influenced by Portugal.
</p><h2>The Grapes</h2><p>The regions closer to the Minho River tend to produce blended wines like Loureira, Albarino and Caino Blanca.  Other whites from the region are blends of Torrontes and Treixadura.  The light red wines are made from the Mencia grape.
</p><h2>The Regions</h2><p>There are no defined regions that separate north from south.  Provinces of Auturias, Cantabria, Galicia, Basque Country, Navarre and Castile Leon are all considered Green Spain.
</p><p>Albarino is one of the more successful grapes in the region of Rias Baixas. They have focused their production on that grape.  One of the main reasons is the success and popularity of Albarino.  The United States is one of the largest importers for Albarino wine.   The Bierzo region is known for their high quality winemaking.  The difficult steep slopes and the labor involved make these wines more expensive.  The Mencia vines are found on these mountainsides.  Mencia is also found in the Valdeorras region who also produces Moscatel, Palomino and Garnacha but the grape Godello is their award winning grape.  Basque Country is known for it’s great food also produces a rich, sharp wine that compliments seafood dishes.
</p><p>Due to the climate of this northern region known as Green Spain, their wines tend to have very aromatic qualities.  The cool misty climate makes for early ripening grapes and most of the wines from the region have a great bouquet, light, crisp and delicious.
</p><h2>Some Wines From Green Spain:</h2><ul>
	<li>La Cana Albarino 2009 from the Rias Baixas region and scored high 90+ Points and is light and crisp.</li>
	<li>Montecillo Verdemar Albarino 2009 is also from the Rias Baixas region.  Clear and bright in fruit, this is a flavorful wine. </li>
	<li>Martin Codax Albarino 2008 is from Rias Baixas and has a fine sparkling sensation on the palate.</li>

</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>In the late 19th century there was a major epidemic in most of the vineyards in Europe known as the Phylloxera epidemic.  To further explain this epidemic we must first look at what the phylloxera is.
</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Originally native to North America this pest is microscopic, yellow sap sucking pests that feed on roots and leaves like plant lice.  The deformations of roots from the pest can cause secondary infections killing the vine.
</p><h2>Devastation</h2><p>The phylloxera epidemic was the cause of botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in 1850 and devastated many vineyards across France and Britain.  In 1863 the effects of the pest were apparent and the problem spread like wildfire throughout the continent.
</p><h2>Cures</h2><p>One desperate measure of wine producers to come up with various cures for the epidemic was burying live toads under each vine to suck out the poison which was unsuccessful.  One of the only remedies was grafting cuttings onto resistant rootstocks and hybridization.
</p><p>Developed by Charles Valentine Riley involved grafting American resistant species with affected roots.  France was devastated and most of Europe saw a significant loss in wine production.  Attempts to destroy the pest have been unsuccessful and are still a problem with some root stock.
</p><h2>Resistance to Phylloxera</h2><p>Some soils were not affected by the phylloxera which includes soils composed of sand and schist.  Due to this epidemic hybridization became a popular way to combat the species.

"30";"2";"Have You Been Corked?";"have-you-been-corked";"0";NULL;"<p>Corked is a term applied to a bad wine from the cork.  Usually noticeable from the undesirable smells or tastes from spoiled wine.  Corked wine can happen to almost any bottle of wine.</p><p>The main cause is a chemical called trichloroanisole (TCA) and or tribromoanisole (TBA) which come from the cork itself. Resembling the smell of old newspapers, moldy wet dog and your old high school gym locker, it does have a recognizable smell.  Although many say that this chemical is harmless to people, it can definitely ruin a good bottle of wine.  They actually measured that there is a 7% occurrence of taint in wine corks.</p>
<p>The cause of this is a little complicated to explain but it mostly comes from the pesticides they spray on the trees that the corks are made from.  The demand on corks are larger than supplies allow so they spray chemicals to prepare the corks faster and spray the cork trees with pesticides to protect the corks. There have been new improvements in the industry which include better screw caps that are more efficient than in previous days.  Synthetic corks are another innovative invention that isn’t affected by TCA, or TCB. </p>
<p>Improvements in cork and screw cap technology brought about a debate as to what is better.  Many sided to still use corks creating many reasons such as to support the cork industry to back their opinions.  Many still associate expensive valuable wines with corks but the findings actually support screw caps.  Since 2004 the screw caps have had a 0% failure rate and can also be recycled easily.  In my opinion, I believe the aesthetics of romance of popping a cork and using a corkscrew makes drinking wine almost as a ritual event and it is hard to unscrew old habits.</p><p><a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/winery-vs-vineyard.html"">Further reading: Winery vs Vineyard - What's the Difference?</a></p><p><a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/"">Further explore our inventory here.</a></p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"Have You Been Corked?";NULL;"Corked is a term applied to a bad wine from the cork.

"32";"2";"​The Difference between Brut and Extra Dry";"the-difference-between-brut-and-extra-dry";"0";NULL;"<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Champagne and Sparkling wines are rated in different levels of dryness.  It could be quite confusing to understand when you see words like Brut and Demi-Sec.  There are also some Champagnes and sparkling wines that are vintage and some labeled “NV” or no vintage.  This term is pretty self explanatory.</span><br>
</p><p>The vintage Champagne pertains to a single year which are pricier than non-vintage.  The non-vintage pertains to a blend of several different years and although it isn’t as pricier doesn’t mean it is bad.  There are many non-vintage Champagnes and Sparkling wines which are very delicious.  The majority of the market is actually dominated by the non-vintage types.
</p><h2>Classifications of Dry</h2><p>To understand the level of dryness is not as hard as you thought it might be.  The classification is simple once you understand the terminology.
</p><p>Extra Brut is the driest out of all the classifications.  Many people might think the extra dry would be the driest but Extra Brut is actually the driest you can get.  The second is Brut which is the second driest Champagne and Sparkling wine.  Extra Dry is in the middle of the road dry and great as an aperitif or to mix with juice to make your favorite mimosa with.  Demi-Sec is the sweetest of classifications and pair well with desserts and fruits.
</p><h2>The Bubbles</h2><p>The bubbles found inside your favorite champagnes and sparkling wines are from the second fermentation process.  Some companies may inject Carbon Dioxide into their wine mixtures which are pretty convenient.  The second and more natural way to add bubbles is by adding sugar and a few grams of yeast which will in turn carbonate the wine.  In the typical bottle of wine the pressure of bubbles is about 80PSI in a typical bottle.
</p><p>The aromas of both champagne and sparkling wine can be reminiscent of pears, apples and fresh bread (from the yeast).  The flavors can range anywhere from apple, strawberry, cream and vanilla with some exhibiting nutty flavors which are more common in Old World champagnes.  The prices vary depending on the size of your wallet but many economy priced champagnes and sparkling wine are quite enjoyable as well as the high priced bottles.

This has got to be one of the biggest misconceptions around.  Many people that ask for wine recommendations, often make “the face” when I show them a reasonably priced wine that has rated well.  After many situations and  reactions of customers it made me come to wonder what really determines the cost of the wine.  After my research, I found some interesting facts.
</p><p>Many factors are involved in determining the cost of a wine.  Everything from quantity produced to location are just a few characteristics that determine price.
</p><p><b>Quantity-</b>   The quantity of wine is one factor that determines cost.  If the vineyard made 20,000 cases as compared to 200 cases then most likely you will pay more for the wine that there is less of.
</p><p><b>Single Vineyard-</b> Single Vineyard is a term used for wines that are produced from a single vineyard and usually is associated with the signature style of the vineyard.  Some wines are blends of different vintages or grapes from different regions which lower their value as compared to a single vineyard.
</p><p><b>Location-</b> Sometimes if a wine comes from a certain area that is known for producing really good wine, then it would influence price.  For a good example I will use Napa Valley.  Napa Valley is known for exceptional wines and many people will buy a wine based on the location where the wine was produced alone.
</p><p><b>Estate Wines-</b> Estate bottled wines are wineries that grow and produce their wine all in one location.  Not to be confused with single vineyard, estate bottled wines are all grown, picked, and produced in one winery where single vineyard wines could acquire their grapes from a region outside the winery.
</p><p><b>Vintage-</b> The vintage is the year the wine was produced.  Sometimes good climate and good weather that isn’t too hot or too cold could make for a great year or great vintage.  The vintages are rated as well by all the wine publications and they have vintage charts available for viewing.  For an example in 2007, Napa and most of California had great climate and weather and so that year made for a good vintage.
</p><p><b>Production Costs-</b> Sometimes manual picking of the grapes as compared to machine picking grapes can factor costs.  Some vineyards that have hills or rough terrain may need to manual pick their grapes and so their production costs are higher.
</p><p><b>Wine Store-</b> Another factor is where you buy your wine.  Some stores mark their wine up to make a profit.  Sometime a bigger wine shop has the available space to purchase quantity discounted wine and in turn can offer a lower price to the public.
</p><p>These are just a few factors involved but has no relation to whether or not the wine is good.  There are many lower priced wines that are equal if not better than high priced wines. Word of mouth is usually the best way to decide what wine you should choose.  Most likely if many customers are constantly purchasing a certain wine, then most likely that wine will be good and price has nothing to do with that.

"34";"2";"Does Vintage Matter?";"does-vintage-matter";"0";NULL;"<p>Keeping inventory in a wine store can be quite tedious.  Trying to find shelf space and keep the vintages separate can drive many people crazy which is why I decided to write about this subject.  Vintage, …what is it? Is it really Important?   Hopefully I can explain how sometimes vintage can mean something good but not in all situations.
</p><p>  Let’s start at the basics.  The word vintage, especially when used to talk about fashion can mean old or outdated.  Like a vintage vest from the seventies, sometimes trends and popularity might bring it back in style.  With wine, it is a bit different.  A vintage wine is a wine produced from a particular area in a particular year.  Most wine labels will show a vintage although some countries do allow a vintage wine to include a portion of wine not from that year.  The percentages of the ratio allowed vary from country to country but it is anywhere from 75% to 95%.  Sometimes this is allowed because it will help with the consistency of the taste of the wine.  So the vintage expresses the year the wine was produced and all the vintages can be rated by a vintage chart.
</p><h2>Vintage Charts</h2><p>  A vintage chart is a list of all the vintages ranging from many years and determines which years were good years.  Now there are a lot of factors that go into a vintage chart to determine what years were good or bad.  Many of these factors include climate, region, weather, etc.  Every year is different and seasons can affect the wine.  Even the slightest change in temperature or an extended harvest, late harvest, or early harvest can determine if you are going to have a great wine.  Many of these charts you can find through major wine publications such as: Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast, Wine Advocate, Etc.  Sometimes major ecological changes or sudden acts of nature like hurricanes or tsunamis can affect the production and harvest of grapes and so many refer to these charts to pick wine.
</p><p>  If a particular region had a great vintage year, it doesn’t mean all the wine from that area is going to be great but it is an assumption that most likely the wine will be good.  So it is possible to have a bad wine from a good vintage and the vintage chart is just an estimate and doesn’t guarantee great wines.  Many use it as a guide with the combination of critic’s opinions and cross referenced, one can generally know which wine to try based on percentages.
</p><p>Whether a vintage is important is debatable.  Sometimes the importance can be exaggerated and through technological farming advances, it is possible to produce good wines in undistinguished years.  Now how important this information matters depends on what wines you buy. Sometimes this vintage system can protect the pricing of aging popular wines and maintain quality.  Other times vintage truly just doesn’t matter.
</p><p>Wine that need to be consumed young and have no aging potential are generally the exception to the vintage charts.  It really doesn’t matter what year your wine is from if it doesn’t have aging ability.  Many times people come in asking for a 2008 Carlo Rossi which is comical because these table wines usually don’t list a vintage because of their  short shelf life.  So the importance of vintage matters on the wine.  If you are a die hard collector and or buying a gift for someone who loves wine, then it is beneficial.  If you are just buying a wine to drink with dinner, than it doesn’t really matter much.  As always I wish you good eats, good friends, and great wine.

I think there is still research going on about the effects of pesticides on the human body.  With all these unknown pesticides, it is no wonder why we have a need for organic eco friendly wines.
</p><p>Organic wines are made from organic grapes that grow without added chemicals, naturally growing the way nature intended.  Originally the term organic carried a stigma and people tend to avoid it like the plague but now a days it seems the demand for high quality natural organic foods have increased dramatically.
</p><p>There are different things to look for on the label when looking for natural organic wine.  With the loopholes in legislature, you have to be careful because that bottle of wine might say organic but might not be as natural as you thought.
</p><p><b>100% Organic-</b> this label means it is made from 100% organically grown ingredients and bears the USDA organic seal.  Usually no sulfites are added.
</p><p><b>Organic-</b> This is not entirely organic.  This would mean that 95% of the ingredients are organically grown while the other 5% isn’t and you will find the USDA symbol on the label.
</p><p><b>Made with Organic grapes-</b> This wine contains about 70% organic ingredients and sulfites might be added.  You will not see the USDA seal on the label.
</p><p><b>Biodynamic-</b> This wine is the best of all.  Made from 100% organic grapes plus the producer has gone that extra mile to grow the grapes a close to nature as possible.  These guys make their own compost and use the astrological calendar to plan their farming.
</p><p>So just be wary when you are reading the labels and make sure you don’t get swindled thinking you are drinking healthy organic wine when you aren’t.  I hope this article helped you and as always, enjoy.

Behind Spain, France comes in second in having the largest total vineyard area dedicated to making wine. France has a long history of producing wine that dates back to the 6th century.
</p><p>France categorizes their wines by ""terroir"" which means the wine styles are defined by the locations or ""appellations"" where the wine is made. France has one of the oldest systems and have strict laws governed by an oversight board called the “INAO"" (Institut National des Appellations d'Origine).
</p><p>These strict laws protect the quality of French wines and many European countries modelled their laws after the French. France categorizes their wines into four categories: Vin de Table, Vin de Pays, Vin Delimite de Qualite Superieure and  Appellation d'Origine Controlee. In 2012 this system will be revised to only three categories which will be: Vin de France, Indication Geographique Protegee and Appellation d'Origine Protegee.
</p><h2>Wine Regions</h2><p>There are too many appellations in France to list but the more popular areas that fall under INAO regulations are:
</p><p><b>Burgundy-</b> Burgundy is divided into a large number of appellations which include: Cote de Nuits, Cote de Beaune, Cote Chalonnaise, Maconnais, Beaujolais, and Chablis.
</p><p><b>Bordeaux-</b> Bordeaux is primarily a red wine region famous for many popular wines such as: Chateau Lafite- Rothschild, Chateau Latour, Chateau Margaux and Chateau Haut-Brion. Regions include: Medoc, Saint Emilion, Pomerol, St-Estephe, Pauillac, St. Julien, Graves, Margaux, Bourg and Blaye.
</p><p><b>Champagne-</b> Champagne is located close to Belgium in Eastern France. One of the coldest regions in France popular for their sparkling wines called Champagne. Champagne can come in white or rose.
</p><p><b>Rhone-</b> Rhone is primarily a red wine region located along the Rhone river in South-Eastern France. Separated into North and South, both regions produce primarily red wines.
</p><p><b>Loire-</b> Loire is primarily a white wine region in Central and Western France. Loire is popular for wines like: Sancerre, Vouvray, and Chenin Blanc.
</p><p><b>SouthWest France-</b> Producers of both Bordeaux style red wine as well as sweet white wines, Southwest France is known for producing: Armagnac, Cotes de Gascogne, and Cotes de Saint-Mont.

"37";"2";"German Classifications and History of wine";"german-classifications-and-history-of-wine";"0";NULL;"<p>German wine dates back to early Roman times.  Germany has a reputation internationally as a producer of elegant and aromatically pure white wines primarily based on the Riesling varietal.  Many of these wines range from crisp to dry and well balanced.  Although the world loves the Germans white wines, Germany has a third of the total surface dedicated to the Pinot Noir or known by its local name as Spatburgunder.  The many styles of German wines vary from semi sweet to sweet as well as Rose, Red wine, and Sparkling wines called Sekt.  Despite producing wines unlike any other in Europe, Germany is still better known for their inexpensive wines.  A majority of the German wine consumed in the country is considerably unlike the majority of wines that are exported are sweet.
</p><h2>Regions</h2><p>  There are about 13 main regions that the wine industry associates quality with.  There are other regions that produce the countries table wines but fall under different quality levels than the 13 popular regions.  These regions are:
</p><p>Ahr, Baden, Franconia, Hessische Bergstrapbe, Mittelrhein, Mosel, Nahe, Palatinate, Rheingau, Rheinhessen, Saale-Unstrut, Saxony, and Wurttemberg.
</p><p>These 13 regions are broken down in to about 39 districts which are further broken down into vineyards.  There are close to 135 grape varietals in Germany.  100 grape varietals are released for white wine and 35 grape varietals are dedicated to red wine production.
</p><h2>Government Laws</h2><p>  The Government created a German wine law which is responsible for drawing up lists of grape varietals allowed for wine production.  They have individual lists for red wine and white wine.  Many of the best vineyards in Germany are steep vineyards overlooking rivers which make it difficult to cultivate and a lot of manual labor is needed to produce the wines.  Many of these wines are produced by using the organic and biodynamic methods.  The vineyards also weigh their grapes with an Oechsle Scale which is a hydrometer scale that weighs the density of the grapes indicating ripeness and adequate sugar content.
</p><h2>Classification</h2><p>  The classification of these wines can be confusing at times.  The labels are very descriptive and also state the ripeness of the grapes used as well as sweet and dryness of the wine.  The confusion sometimes comes from the classification of sweet or dry that pertains to minimum sugar content or the amount of potential alcohol based on estimated fermenting of those sugars.  So the ripeness doesn’t explain how sweet the wine is after production but actually the estimated levels based on the weight of the sugar levels in the grapes.  Some of the terms used are:
</p><p>Kabinett, Spatlese, Auslese, Beerenauslese, Eiswein, Trockenbeerenauslese, Trocken, and Halbtrocken.

It accounts for $5.5 billion dollars annually to the nation’s economy.  It has a major shar in south Asian wine markets and is second largest in the India markets.  Australia consumes almost 500 million liters of wine per year. The major varietals are Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Semillon, Pinot Noir, Riesling and Sauvignon Blanc.</p><p>  The history dates back to 1788 where cuttings of vines came from the penal colony of New South Wales from the Cape of Good Hope.  The attempt to make wine from these cuttings didn’t work out so well but the settlers managed to cultivate vines suitable for winemaking.  Some of the first wine produced was in 1820 and available for sale locally.  Gregory Blaxland was one of the first to export wine in 1822 and he also won an overseas award. </p><p>  Early wine producers faced many difficulties due to the climate and terroir.  After a few years of history, they finally saw success at the 1873 exhibition of Vienna where French Judges enjoyed until they found out where it originated.  As Australia continued winning high honors in French competitions, they were hit pretty hard during the phylloxera epidemic.  Up until the late 1970s, Australia produced many sweet and fortified wines but since has rapidly become a leader in quantity and quality.  Over the last twenty years, Australia suffered low grape priced which the government urged producers to pull their vines and clean skin wines was introduced.  Since this long period of history, organic and biodynamic farming has been popular and they have seen a demand for organic wines in the European markets.</p><p>   Australia’s wine regions are regulated like their labels and divided into South Eastern Australia, Victoria wine region, New South Wales wine region, and the Western Australia wine region.

There are so many benefits to hosting a party where you can share your thoughts and opinions on wine.  It is a neat way to share your love of wine with a variety of new and interesting wines.  You don’t need to invite a lot of guests and just keep it to those who would share the same appreciation of wine with you.</p><p>  You can make your party theme orientated by picking a certain wine category.  For instance maybe have a Super Tuscan party, A French Bordeaux party or mix it up and have an around the world wine party and experience wines from all over.  Many people tend to associate the season with their party so if you are having a party in the summertime, then you would most likely have sangria or sparkling, refreshing, white wines.  Be creative and ask your local wine merchant for recommendations.  They can be a great deal of help and a great resource when picking your wine.  By minimum, you should have about 6 bottles for 12 people and maybe other cocktails available after the tasting.</p><p>  Once you picked your wine, you might want to decide what food to serve.  If you are going with a theme, then you might want to follow through with food from the same region.  For instance, if you are having a Spanish wine tasting then maybe serve some tapas with the wine to tie in the flavors of the country as well as the beautiful wine you choose.  Cheeses, fruits, unsalted crackers, and other munchies should be available for guests.  Nothing screams “Party” more than d’oeuvres.  Another option available for guests is spit buckets and bottled water to clean your palate between wines.</p><p>  Once you have the guest lists and your wines, one of the most important things is to serve your wine at the correct temperatures and know your wine etiquette.  Learn about pouring and do some research so you can impress your company with knowledge of the region.  Take notes of color, clarity, the legs, aromas, and all the other great things you have enjoyed about wine and share that with your friends….As always “Enjoy”.     </p><p>Further reading: <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/have-you-been-corked.html"">Have you been corked?</a></p><p><a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/"">Learn more about our wines and spirits here</a>.</p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"Hosting a wine tasting party";NULL;"What better way to get people together than a good wine tasting party.

Choosing the right food can help in the fight against obesity and making little changes can help.  With red wine becoming more popular for its help in fighting cardiovascular disease, there is not much information on wine labels to help determine the calories in a glass of wine.
</p><p>Just like any other product, too much of a good thing can sometimes be bad.  Hopefully this article will help with deciding whether or not to add that glass a day of wine to your diet.  You don’t have to worry too much about fats in wine because there isn’t any but the thing you might want to keep an eye on is the sugar content.  Sugar is a carbohydrate that occurs naturally in every fruits and vegetable.
</p><p> The way sugar affects our diet is when we take more sugary carbohydrates in than we burn.  At 16 calories per teaspoon, sugar is not fattening but any excess calories from sugar that the body doesn’t need gets stored in the body and you gain weight.  Below is some estimated information on the calories contained in a bottle of wine.
</p><h2>Calories per varietal:</h2><p><b>Port, Muscatel, fortified wines-</b> These wines, especially fortified wines may be high in alcohol.  Some even contain levels around 18% percent.  The wines are on the sweeter side and contain the most sugar than other wines.  These wines can contain anywhere from 900 calories to 1,200 calories per bottle.
</p><p><b>Cream sherry, Sweet, fortified, wines-</b> These wines can also contain high levels of alcohol as well as sugar levels around 1,065 calories per bottle.
</p><p><b>Dry, fortified, Sherry, wines-</b> These wines can contain high levels of alcohol and around anywhere from 600 to 780 calories per bottle.  If one serving size glass is around 6 oz., than you can get around 4 to 5 glasses out of a 750ml size bottle.
</p><p><b>Champagne, Sparkling wines-</b> These pleasant sparkling crisp refreshing drinks are a must for celebrations and toasts.  On average a bottle of champagne, white and brut or extra dry can contain anywhere from 450 to 531 calories per bottle.
</p><p><b>Red wines, Rose, Medium bodied wines-</b> These wines are actually among the healthiest for you.  Red wine contains high levels of resveratrol which studies have shown can help reduce the thickening of arteries and help improve cardiovascular disease.  Red wines contain around 500 to 562 calories per bottle.
</p><p><b>White wines, dry, table white wines-</b> These wines are great with light meals and appetizers.  They can run anywhere between 480 to 560 calories per bottle.
</p><p>  These figures are estimated and the true calorie count depends mostly on the type of wine you are drinking.  Some white wines like pinot grigio are more on the dry side than a vinho verde which may change the calorie count per bottle.  Upon average, a glass of white or red wine can contain anywhere from 100 to 140 calories per 6 oz. glass.  The 6oz. serving size is based on what bars and restaurants serve customers.  Glass serving sizes vary on the consumer.
</p><p>  The good thing about wine is that it does not contain any fats which with moderation can actually help a healthy diet.  Even moderate intake of alcohol can benefit the body by decreasing the risks of strokes, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.  But like I mentioned before, moderation is the key.  Excess abuse of alcohol can not only damage the liver but can cause major health problems if abused excessively.  Doctors urge older patients to drink about a glass of red wine per day with dinner or to be a bit more technical, 140g to 210 grams per week for men and 84g- 140 grams per week for women.  Of course consumption is not recommended for pregnant women or women who breastfeed.  Below is a chart that might make things a little easier.

"41";"2";"How to Become a Sommelier";"how-to-become-a-sommelier";"0";NULL;"<p>If you don’t know what a sommelier is than maybe I can clarify things for you.  A sommelier is someone that is trained and knowledgeable about wine.  Also called a wine steward, sommeliers usually work in fine restaurants and they provide a service that differs from that of a wine waiter.  </p><p>A sommelier is great with recommending a wine based on food pairings and can tell you the history of the wine.  A wine waiter can just basically tell you pricing and what is stated on the back label.  A real sommelier has a tastevin around his neck which is a small cup that they can judge the maturity and taste of the wine.  </p><p>These cups were created by Burgundy winemakers to help them judge the clarity and color of a wine in a dim lit cellar.  These tastevin had a shiny inner surface which helped reflect the light.  Unfortunately modern technology made the tastevin obsolete.  Some Sommeliers wear a ribbon around their necks to symbolize tradition.</p><p>  So to become a sommelier is not too hard.  There are different levels of sommelier which include master sommelier.  The first court of master sommeliers was founded in London in 1977.  There are still exams held to this day in the United Kingdon and North America.  </p><p>There are four levels of certification and the introductory course is a two day seminar.  To become a master is a little harder with different sections of testing which include standing in front of six glasses of wine and blindly identify them correctly.  </p><p>Another part of the master test is in a restaurant where you are giving tips for correctly pouring and opening still and sparkling wines while being asked questions from the previous tests.  The percentage rates of passing the masters certification is very low and very hard to pass but if wine is your passion, then you might want to consider becoming a sommelier.  </p><p>A simple internet search will give you all the answers you need and think becoming a sommelier is a great certification to add to your resume.  As always, enjoy.</p><p>Further reading: <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/hosting-a-wine-tasting-party.html"">Hosting a wine tasting party</a></p><p><a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/"">Learn more about our wines and spirits here</a>.</p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"How to Become a Sommelier";NULL;"If you don’t know what a sommelier is than maybe I can clarify things for you.

"42";"2";" How to serve Wine";"how-to-serve-wine";"0";NULL;"<p>I know you might not think it is difficult to serve wine and I guess anyone can pretty much pour a bottle of wine but there are a few tricks that might help enhance your experience and or your drinker’s experience.  The idea is to get the very best out of your bottle of wine and these little tips may help you on your next wine serving adventure.  It really isn’t too hard and the tricks are really some basic wine knowledge to help.
</p><h2>Wine temperatures</h2><p>  Believe it or not, some people don’t know what temperature to serve wine at.  White wines are best served chilled but Red Wines are best served at room temperature.  Many people don’t know this and they serve their red wine chilled.
</p><h2>Use the right Glasses</h2><p>  You can pretty much serve wine in a goblet or chalice if you wanted to but it is better to use a wine glass.  Believe it or not wine glasses are designed to allow for oxygen to have a wider contact with the wine which allows the wine to breathe, getting better flavor and aromas out of your wine.  There are glasses for all types of wines, liquors, champagne, etc. They are all designed to enhance the experience of the drink.
</p><h2>Use an Aerator</h2><p>  Allowing your wine to breathe is the best thing you can do to enhance the flavor of the wine.  Aerators diffuse the wine and allow oxygen to open up the more floral aromas of the wine.  There are other ways to allow your wine to breathe, another way is to use a decanter which not only has an aesthetic look but allows more surface area of the wine to be exposed to oxygen.
</p><h2>Servings</h2><p>  Don’t over pour your wine.  The rule is to leave enough room in the glass so that you can swirl your wine around to see the legs of the wine.  By swirling the wine, you allow the wine to breathe more which in the end gives you great flavor and aromas.
</p><p>When you apply these simple and easy techniques, you will not only be able to enjoy your wine more but also your company will get to enjoy the experience and will most likely thank you later.  So now you are on your way to making every occasion more memorable.

"43";"2";"Is wine good for your teeth?";"is-wine-good-for-your-teeth";"0";NULL;"<p>We are always reminded by them humorous detergent commercials showing the red wine stains on clothing and wondering what effects wine has on our teeth.  Wine can be very acidic and may contain staining agents as well as residuals sugars that may damage our teeth.  Many people switched to drinking white wine because of the association with red wine and staining but recent research has actually found different findings.</p><p>  Most of the bacteria that damage our teeth are called streptococcus and they live in our mouths feeding on the sugars in our diet.  It usually sticks to the enamel and triggers a process called demineralization, where holes are formed through the acid released from the bacteria.  Scientists found an active ingredient called proanthocyanidins which are compounds found in grape skins and they block these bacteria from sticking to the enamel.  Other studies showed that polyphenols fight off diseases of periodontitis which affect the gums and bones in the mouth.  These compounds were also found in cranberries and they help prevent plaque and cavities. </p><p>  The only downside to this finding is that wine and both cranberries and the products containing these also contain a lot of sugars which can be bad for the teeth.  Clinical testing are trying to find ways of adding these benefits to toothpastes and mouthwash without the sugars.  So don’t be afraid to sip on the favorite cocktail and drink that red wine. </p><p>Further reading: <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/how-many-calories-are-in-wine.html"">How many calories are in wine?</a></p><p><a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/"">Learn more about our wines and spirits here</a>.</p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"Is wine good for your teeth?";NULL;"We are always reminded by them humorous detergent commercials showing the red wine stains on clothing and wondering what effects wine has on our teeth.

"44";"2";"Joining a Wine club";"joining-a-wine-club";"0";NULL;"<p>Joining a wine club can be quite fun and enjoyable.  Whether it is a social get together to appreciate wine, or an internet wine club that offers great discounts and sends you bottles periodically, both can be great experiences.
</p><h2>The Social Wine Club</h2><p> The social get together is great for meeting new people.  A common appreciation can bring together friends and actually be educational.  There is a lot to learn about wine and when you combine that with common conversations with friends, it is almost therapeutic.  I have met many people who loved their wine clubs because many times they got to taste a wine they most likely would never have tried on their own.  They learned the differences between a nicely aged bottle of wine and also became more familiar with the lingo sometimes associated with this industry.  Terms like aromas, bouquets, to terms like Super Tuscans become more understandable.  There are many free wine clubs where all you do have to bring is a nice bottle of wine.  Another benefit is that most of the time consuming information about varietals and other topics are usually done by the leader of the club.  You can find many of these groups on your social media sites like “facebook”, “Yahoo’, Etc.
</p><h2>Internet Wine Clubs</h2><p>  Internet Wine clubs can be a great way to sample and get the chance to experience wines both red and white that you otherwise might not have found.  Another benefit is to get premium wines at great discounted prices.  Many of these clubs have a variety of reasonable prices that anyone could afford and options on how frequent you could schedule your wine.  One tip on joining these clubs is to find out the local laws of your state because many laws apply to different states and an adult signature is always required when receiving alcohol in the mail.  Sample everything from award winning wines to some of the most popular wines on the market.
</p><p>Both clubs offer a great chance and opportunity to explore and become a more educated wine connoisseur.  Before joining a club, make sure you do some research and find out all the details before jumping in.  Ask friends or even your local wine shop if they can offer any information about these clubs.  Most times your local wine shop will have a wine club or a website where you can get discounts and offers.  Last but not least enjoy yourself, joining a wine club should be fun and social with people just like yourself.  So get out there and enjoy.

"45";"2";"Making Wine at Home";"making-wine-at-home";"0";NULL;"<p>Ever wanted to try to make your own wine but always thought it was too difficult to make?  It actually is not that difficult and could be a fun project to try one day, who knows, maybe you might be the next Robert Mondavi.  Most of the people I speak to that make their own wine tell me that it is a rewarding hobby.  There are kits available with a basic online search; you can find inexpensive wine making kits online.  Now with making wine, you have to experiment a little to get the style of wine that is more suitable for your tastes.  Results vary with every batch but most of the time; you will wind up with a pretty descent drinkable wine.  Now when you make wine you don’t always have to use grapes.  You can mix it up and use all different types of fruits like apples, peaches, pears, etc.  As far as some of the equipment you need include:
</p><ol>
	<li>Sugar</li>
	<li>Yeast (found in brewing shops or supermarkets)</li>
	<li>A large plastic tub to put the juice in and also needs a lid.</li>
	<li>A juicer (for lazy people who don’t want to squeeze their fruits)</li>
	<li>A glass fermenting jug. A large glass jar with an airlock.  Something like mason jars but only larger.</li>
	<li>A plastic tube for siphoning</li>
</ol><h2>Steps</h2><p>  The first step is to get the juice.  Some kits or recipes suggest watering down your fruit juice but I disagree.  If you want a flavorful wine then don’t add the water.  The electric juicer is great for hard fruits like apples and pears.  There are many ways to extract the juice from your fruit.  One method is boiling your fruits in a little water but this will lighten the flavor.  Another method is to soak the fruit for a few days which is a good way to get extra coloring from the skins of the fruit.  This step of making wine can be the most fun because you can include the kids and try to do it the old fashion way by stepping on your fruit like they did in the past.  Stepping and crushing your fruit can be a little messy but a great memory making moment to share with family and friends.  Some people mix fruits which has been successful so you might want to try that.
</p><p>  The second step is to add the sugar.  Some juices are already naturally sweet so you will not need to add sugar but most fruit juices do need a little extra sugar.  The ratio of sugar added is two pounds of sugar to one gallon of juice.  This ratio will make a sweet wine but if you prefer a dry style wine, you can reduce the amount of sugar.  Always remember that the more sugar in the juice will create a higher alcohol wine.  One of the better ways to add the sugar to your juice is to slowly simmer your juice in a large stainless steel pot and dissolve the sugar into the juice.
</p><p>  The next step on our way to making some great wine is to add the yeast.  Dissolve your yeast in a little warm water to activate the yeast.  Usually there are instructions on the temperature of the water to activate the yeast.  After activating the yeast wait a few minutes then add the yeast to your juice and seal up the jar.  The fermentation should start soon and you will know by seeing bubbles which is the yeast converting the sugar to alcohol.
</p><p>  The waiting game is the name step.  Put your jar in a warm place and leave it.  The longer you wait, the better your wine will taste.  Average time is about nine months to a year.  It can be consumed earlier but it will be rougher and not as good.  The waiting really makes a difference.  Now you do have to maintain the juice once a month.  You will begin to notice a white layer appearing on the bottom of the jar which is the dead yeast cells falling to the bottom.  To prevent the wine from absorbing the yeast taste, you should siphon out the juice to another container and discard the dead yeast cells.  Do not bottle your wine until the juice is clear.  Once the bubbles stop showing and the juice is clear, you can then bottle your wine for storage.
</p><p>Some tips to remember are to store the wine away.  Resist the temptation of drinking it at this stage and store it in a cool place for up to two years.  Enjoy it with friends and family and reap the benefits of your rewards.  There is no exact recipe and experimenting with all different types of fruits and juices is good.  Eventually you will find your style and have your own personal recipe.  So enjoy and have fun.  If the wine comes out really good then please send me a bottle.  As always enjoy.

"46";"2";"Organic Wine: Is it Healthier?";"organic-wine-is-it-healthier";"0";NULL;"<p>There are so many topics to write about when dealing with organic wines.
</p><ul>
	<li>Do they cause headaches? </li>
	<li>Do they taste better? </li>
	<li>Are they healthier than regular wine?  </li>
</ul><p>These questions are just a few many are seeking the answers for.  It is kind of hard to tell what is true or false with all the studies that contradict each other with the answers about health benefits, etc.
</p><p>So how can we truly make a reasonable decision when the facts are not genuine?
</p><p>I think if we take a step back and look at the small details than maybe we might wiggle our way out of this heap of information that’s harder to swallow than a corked wine.
</p><p>Why do we use pesticides in the first place?
</p><p>Pesticides are toxic and are used to kill pests at a small enough dosage so it isn’t harmful to humans.  The benefits are that larger crops can be harvested, prevent weeds or damage from rodents and molds.  Many supporters say we couldn’t keep up with the demand for food if we grow all organic due to loss of crops to pests, rodents and molds.
</p><p>There is not enough research to determine how dangerous these pesticides are to us but many suggest that they strip the vitamins and minerals and important disease fighting agents from the food which could help us fight off cancers, and other ailments and diseases.
</p><p>Pesticides have been linked to birth defects, cancers, neurological and developmental and disruption to the endocrine system.  Not only to us but the disappearance of honey bees, the death of many bats and other environmental disasters are linked to pesticides.
</p><p>Other studies suggest that foods become richer in vitamins and minerals do to the facts that weeds, rodents and pests aren’t stripping the fruits and vegetables of their vitamins.  So does convenience and affordability out weigh health?
</p><p>Organic wines preserve the uniqueness of the land and terroir which give characteristics to wine. Many people suggest organic wines are tastier due to all the minerals and vitamins that aren’t affected by pesticides.
</p><p>Although there is more research needed, Organic wines and foods have become more and more popular.  It is really hard to tell if organic wine is tastier or healthier but one thing is for certain which is that our fore fathers made wine pesticide free and like the saying goes, “if the clock isn’t broken, don’t fix it.”  Do the research for yourself and let me know what you find.  As always I hope this information helps you make a healthier decision and enjoy.

"47";"2";"Origins of wine";"origins-of-wine";"0";NULL;"<p>The English word “wine” comes from the Latin word “vinum” or “vine”.  The v and the w became interchangeable from the Proto-Germanic word “winam”. The earliest evidence of production of wine dates back over 8,000 years ago.  8,000 year old ceramic storage jars in the Georgian region of Shulavari were found.  In these storage jars were evidence of crushed grapes.
</p><p> Even earlier than that in Ancient Egypt, six of 36 amphoras were found in the tomb of King Tutankhamun bearing the name Kha’y who was the chief vintner.  These amphoras dated back to the 7th century B.C.  Other traces of wine have also been found in Asia dating from the 1st and 2nd millennia B.C.  India also has a history with wine by the first mentioning of grape based wines in the late 4th century B.C. in writings of Chanakya.  Of course the Romans also have a history and taught many of the production techniques that are still used today.
</p><p>  Most of the wine was made from the species Vitis Vinifera which translates to common varieties such as Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon ,Gamay and Merlot.  Throughout the years there have been many hybrids and cross breeds of these varieties which are used for the production of wine.
</p><h2>Hybridization and Grafting</h2><p>  Grafting- This is a horticultural technique where one root or plant tissue is inserted into another plant so that they become one.  For instance an apple tree may be grafted onto a dwarf tree because they provide more fruit per unit of land.  Grafting can sometimes overcomes a roots deficiency and strengthen its weaknesses.
</p><p>Hybridization- This technique combines different varieties together to create a hybrid.  This process takes longer than grafting.  This method is more an act of mating varieties to create a hybrid.
</p><p>Both of these techniques are used to strengthen and make a new hardy crop which may be more disease resistant from the original.
</p><h2>Terroir</h2><p>  Terroir comes from the word Terre or translated to land in French.  This term is associated with many grape varieties and is a term used to describe a characteristic of the geography, geology and climate of certain regions.  Terroir is used in many European countries and used to categorize wines made from certain areas.  For instance Bordeaux refers to the terroir or style rather than a varietal like in The U.S. where you find Cabernet Sauvignon.  Terroir are regulated by the governments to keep the values of wines and protect traditional winemaking techniques.
</p><h2>New World wine and Old World wine</h2><p>  Old World Wine refers to wine produced in countries that have a long traditional history in winemaking.  Countries like Italy, France, Spain, etc.  These countries have been following a standard and tradition using the same techniques that were used for many years.
</p><p>New World Wine refers to countries that are relatively new at making wine and use varietals and blends that wouldn’t be normally used. Some of the New World regions or countries would be Australia, Chile, U.S., etc.
</p><h2>Tasting wine</h2><p>  There is an art to wine tasting and many terms and lingo are associated with wine.  Terms like bouquet, aromas, full or light bodied, etc., are examples of some of the terms used.  When drinking wine it is sometimes best to swirl it in your glass to aerate the wine and release aromas and flavors. There are accessories that can aid in your wine tasting experiences such as decanters, aerators, vacuum seals and glasses designed for wine.
</p><h2>Collecting wines</h2><p>  Some wines have a greater ability to age.  The levels of tannins or acidity in certain wines give the wine the ability to get better in taste and are able to be stored or collected.  Some of these wines are rated highly by wine publications.
</p><p>These are just a few of the terms and history behind wine.  Wine has been enjoyed for centuries and with the new techniques and the new production methods that are being used, wine will only get better.  Any questions or comments are welcomed and encouraged.

"48";"2";"Picking a wine in a restaurant";"picking-a-wine-in-a-restaurant";"0";NULL;"<p>It can be a little difficult to choose a wine from a restaurants wine list.  Most of the time the descriptions of wines are often inaccurate or are brief sentences and the prices are so extraordinarily high that it sometimes can intimidate you into choosing a bad wine.  Most restaurants also are unequipped to provide a sommelier or a waitperson with considerable wine knowledge.  It is hard enough to choose the food from the menu let alone the wine, so here are a few tips to help you make a confident decision.</p><p>  Go with what you know and choose familiar bottles of wine you like.  Experimenting and blind choosing a wine you have never tried can turn a good dinner into a horrible experience.  Let’s face it, you want to make a good impression on your dining companions especially if you are on a date so always pick a wine that you have enjoyed and don’t make the mistake of picking blindly. </p><p> Do not think that the expensive bottles of wine are the best.  As we all know, the         pricing of wine in a restaurant can be highway robbery and most bottles are marked up twice the retail value, if not more.  Always remember that price doesn’t reflect quality and it can be very disappointing but an expensive bottle of wine can taste cheap.</p><p>  Don’t be afraid to ask questions about the wine.  Most of the wine lists in good restaurants should have all the information regarding vintage, varietal, and price.  If the wine list doesn’t include this info then ask for it.  This is a scam for some restaurants trying to profit from an undesirable vintage.  Also beware of the “mark up”.  If you know what you would pay for the wine in a wine store than the restaurants price should be no more than twice the cost of the store price.  If the wine is more than twice than you know you are paying too much.</p><p>  Call the restaurant to see if you could bring your own bottle.  Some restaurants allow you to bring your own bottle and usually just charge a corking fee per bottle.  Calling ahead also gives you an opportunity to see what wines they do have available and their pricing.  Also be ready for some uncomfortable looks if you bring a bottle from their menu.  They might not mind if you bring a bottle they don’t stock but if you bring something from their list, they might give you some hassle.</p><p>  Be wary of the overpriced glass.  You can get four glasses out of an average sized bottle so if that one glass is priced for more than the bottle cost, it would be better to just buy the bottle.</p><p>  Not all restaurants are highway robbers and some are honest so don’t let one bad experience ruin your respect for your restaurant Sommelier.  At the same point you shouldn’t believe everything you see.  If something jumps out of the wine list and tells you it’s a great price then most likely it is too good to be true.</p><p>These are just a few tips that can help you with the daunting task of ordering wine at your restaurant.  I think the main thing to remember is to make a confident and educated decision.  Go with your knowledge of what you know about wine and you should be fine. Enjoy!</p><p>Further reading: <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/origins-of-wine.html"">Origins of Wine</a></p><p>Learn more about our wines and spirits <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com"">here</a>.</p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"Picking a wine in a restaurant";NULL;"It can be a little difficult to choose a wine from a restaurants wine list.

"49";"2";"Can Red Wine be Chilled?";"can-red-wine-be-chilled";"0";NULL;"<p>The title of this article is almost sacrilegious to some.  The rules for wine have been set in stone since the beginning of time.  White wines should be served chilled and red wines should be served at room temperature.  But like many rules, some should be broken and there are a few reds that can be served chilled.
</p><p>  Among the chosen few are the light, softer reds like maybe a pinot noir, zinfandels, etc.  What people tend to do is serve their white wines too cold and red wines to warm.  The ideal temperature of chilled is around 50 and 60 degrees or 15 minutes in an ice bucket.  Over chilling a wine changes the characteristics of the wine.  By freezing or serving white wine too cold you suppress the aromas and flavors of the wine.  With red wine by chilling or freezing it below these average levels you make the red wine taste more astringent and although the alcohol may be masked, you increase the dryness characteristics of red wine.  You often find Europeans chill their wines especially in areas of France.  A nicely chilled red on a warm day can be quite refreshing.
</p><p>Now the best way to chill a wine is up to you.  A majority believe a bucket of ice is the best way to chill a wine but that is up to you.  I have gathered some temperatures that wine should be served at.  Hopefully this will help you.

"50";"2";"Shipping Laws for Wine and Spirits ";"shipping-laws-for-wine-and-spirits";"0";NULL;"<p>In the United States of America which stands for unity and freedom, we see a major contradiction when it comes to shipping alcohol.  The frustrating and daunting efforts by so many trying to send loved ones and friends gifts of wine get stumped by the unorganized shipping laws.  </p>
<p>So many people call and complain and place the blame on the stores when in fact it is a problem that starts with the legislation.  As a matter of fact, some who may try to ship may get heavily fined or might be committing a crime.</p>
<p>The problem lies in each state having the right to control how alcohol is sold.  Instead of a unified system that allows wine and spirit commerce to be free between states, we are forced to suffer.  </p>
<p>Another problem is that because of these complicated laws, the major businesses that ship like UPS or FedEx refuse to ship and or if you do manage to ship your order may be confiscated and lost.  Nearly half of the states make it illegal for anyone trying to send wine to a consumer's home.  Trying to send wine in the regular USPS is a federal crime.  </p>
<p>Fourteen states and the District of Columbia allow shipment of alcohol but the seller and or consumer has to register with the state and pay either for a shipping permit or for the taxes.  Some states like Alabama, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Utah, and Texas prohibit the shipment of alcohol although some do allow shipment from retailer to retailer.  </p>
<p>Please note that most of these laws consistently change on a regular basis so it would be best to check with your state legislation before sending your friend a great bottle of wine.  </p>
<p>All the different laws can be a little confusing and complicated at times.  In order to find more information, you have to write to or find on the internet for each state you wish to ship to.</p><p>Further reading: <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/can-red-wine-be-chilled.html"">Can Red Wine be Chilled?</a></p><p>Learn more about our wines and spirits <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/"">here</a>.</p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"Shipping Laws for Wine and Spirits ";NULL;"In the United States of America which stands for unity and freedom, we see a major contradiction when it comes to shipping alcohol.

"51";"2";"The Sugar Content in Wine";"sugar-content-in-wine";"0";NULL;"<p>Many people tend to ask the question about how much sugar is in wine.  Now that we are becoming more conscience of our diets and trying to become healthier it is important to know the details of what we consume. </p><p>There are many methods to how a wine becomes sweet and once you understand the science behind the numbers, you will be able to determine the best wine for you.  How sweet a wine will taste depends on many factors such as alcohol and acidity levels, and  the  amount of tannins present.  The sugar that is left after the fermentation of wine is called residual sugar.
</p><p>  The science behind this is that as grapes grow they develop sugars through a process of translocation of sucrose molecules produced through photosynthesis from the leaves.  These sucrose molecules are converted into glucose and fructose by enzymes and become simple sugars. </p><p> Most fruit including grapes become sweeter as they age so the later you harvest the sweeter the grapes will be.  This sugar is converted to alcohol by a method called fermentation.  Fermentation is the process where they use yeast to change the sugars into alcohol.  The sweetness is determined by how long the fermentation process lasts.
</p><h2>Residual sugar</h2><p>  Residual sugar is measured in grams per liter of wine usually represented by g/l or g/L.  The lowest amount of sugar you will find is about 1g/L.  it is rare to find any level lower because some sugars like Pentose is not able to be fermented. </p><p> The highest amount of sugars can range anywhere well above 50g/l.  Wines like Tokaji and some ice wines are over 100 g/l but are balanced with acidity to make them very delicious.  There is also some wines that add residual sugar to a wine to purposely make them sweeter and this process is called Suss reserve.  This process is practiced mostly in areas like Germany.
</p><h2>Terms of sweetness</h2><p>  There are different words or names that are associated with sweet and dry wines as well as the levels of sweetness in sparkling wines.  I will try to explain them in more detail below.
</p><h2>Champagne and Sparkling wines:</h2><p>1. Brut Natural- contains around 0-3 g/l of sugar
</p><p>2. Extra Brut- contains 0-6g/l
</p><p>3. Brut- contains 0-12 g/l
</p><p>4. Extra Dry, Extra Sec, Extra Seco- contains12-17 g/l
</p><p>5. Dry, Sec, Seco- contains 17-32 g/l
</p><p>6. Demi-Sec, Semi Seco- contains 32-50 g/l
</p><p>7. Doux, Sweet, Dulce- contains 50+g/l
</p><p>Wines are labeled a little different because of the acidity and alcohol levels which can mask a wines sugar content and make you believe they contain less sugars.
</p><h2>Wines:</h2><p>1. Dry- Dry wines fall somewhere around or up to 4 g/l depending on acidity and alcohol.
</p><p>2. Medium Dry- These wines have up to 12 g/l
</p><p>3. Medium- These wines have up to 45 g/l
</p><p>4. Sweet- These wines have more than 45 g/l
</p><p>These levels are estimated and vary depending on the acidity and alcohol.  People tend to associate sweet wines with being cheap or inexpensive but in fact it is quite the opposite.  Some really expensive wines that are sweet usually use varietals of grapes that have high acidity.  Sometimes too much acidity can make a wine taste dry and vice versa, too much alcohol can make a wine taste sweet. </p><p> For instance with a wine like Vouvray which can sometimes taste really dry, it is actually a sweet wine with high levels of acidity.  Some of the more expensive wines like Sauternes or Tokaji contain high levels of sugars but are quite enjoyable because of the careful balance of acidity and alcohol.  Hopefully this helps a little with your next bottle of wine.

"52";"2";"Summer Wine Recommendations";"summer-wine-recommendations";"0";NULL;"<p>I absolutely love the warmer seasons and especially summer.  Having the chance to throw on some shorts and a t-shirt and soaking up the sun feel so good.  A time for some simple living and relaxation are also on the menu and there are some really good wines to compliment your carefree mood.  Summer wines should be light, fruity and refreshing.  Summer is the time to put away the complex full bodied, depth filled hearty wines and break out simplicity.  Whether you are jumping in the pool, flipping burgers or just sailing away with the wind in your hair, you should have a wine to reflect your attitude.</p><p> A nice Rose to share with a loved one can re-spark romance and pairs well with that fresh fruit bowl.  Another good suggestion would be a nice Vinho Verde to enhance the mood.  A truly great inexpensive wine that is charming and young.  Vinho Verde mixed with a little sparkling soda can make a great spritzer.  Try Gazela or Famega white Vinho Verde.  Both are reasonably priced with light fruity, peach, green apple flavors and are  great with seafood.  When it comes to red wine, I would suggest a nice light Pinot Noir.  Gloria Ferrer Carneros Pinot Noir makes a great Pinot Noir which is also good to add to that old hamburger recipe bringing out the sweetness of the meat.  My other suggestion would be a nice sparkling wine.</p><p>  Sparkling wines are made for summer with their tickling bubbles. There are so many to choose from and  are best served chilled.  Try a nice Prosecco like Mionetto or Riondo, or go for a nice Nando Fragolino, that has hints of strawberries.  Cava’s like Freixenet are also good to pair with salads and appetizers.</p><p>The last good wine on my list of favorites would be a nice sweet Moscato.  Bartenura make a great Moscato that comes in a nice blue bottle and has such a clean, sweet taste that you could almost skip dessert and just drink the bottle instead.  I think the best suggestion for summer wine would be to have fun.  Enjoy the weather and share lasting moments with friends and family, so as always I wish you good friends, good food and great wine.</p><p>Further reading: <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/sugar-content-in-wine.html"">The Sugar Content in Wine</a></p><p>Learn more about our wines and spirits <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/"">here</a>.</p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"Summer Wine Recommendations";NULL;"I absolutely love the warmer seasons and especially summer.

"53";"2";"Tannins: Overview, Benefits, Side Effects, & More";"tannins-overview";"0";NULL;"<p>Any wine connoisseur is going to run into the term Tannins when drinking wine.  Although the word is freely used in many wine circles, some may not know the exact meaning of the word.  The word Tannin has quite a history, originally coming from the word tanning.  Tannins or tanning was a term applied to the tanning and curing of animal skins.  Tannins are located in plants and the extracted polyphenolic compounds bind well with proteins changing the properties.  In plants, tannins act as a defense mechanism giving an unpleasant taste to its leaves to sway off herbivores.  This process exists in grape vines and in wine.
</p><p>  Tannins found in wine are actually quite helpful in giving a distinctive taste to a wine.  The pleasant combination of sugar, acidity and tannins can produce an amazing tasting wine.  The next time you taste a dry red wine, it is most likely due to the amount of tannins in the wine.  The tannins bind to the saliva proteins of the mouth giving you that pucker type dry feeling.  They can also add a little bitterness which can compliment a wine with a lot of sugar or acid.  Not only do the tannins give quality to wine but it also gives the ability of aging.  You may come across a review that might say drinks young or will be better in 1-2 years.  Terms like these are based on the tannins.  Wine sometimes when first bottled may be big and very tannic or astringent, but as the years go by, the tannins soften and give great quality to many red wines.  So the real secret to producing great red wines is based on how you control your tannins.  There is also research that might suggest that the tannins affect the color of wine as well.
</p><h2>Health Benefits</h2><p>  The newest craze and research is on Resveratrol which is a molecule found in the skin of grapes.  There is a host of health effects promoting the consumption of full bodied wines.  The benefits include prolonging the life of obese mice, as well as benefiting the cardiovascular system.  To be a bit more scientific, oligomeric procyanidins also known as flavanoids are in fact condensed tannins which suppress production of peptides which are responsible for hardening arteries.  Although more research is needed in this area, it was shown that red wine has reduced the risks of stroke and heart attacks and Alzheimer’s disease.  Other reports say that tannic acid can help maintain normal kidney function, and act as an anti-inflammatory agent in the stomach possessing inflammatory properties helping bowel movements.
</p><h2>The Downside</h2><p>  The good definitely outweighs the bad but there are a few downsides to tannins.  Tannins are located in everything from chocolate to coffee, wine and many other products.  One downside is that tannins love to stain which is why dentist recommend limiting coffee or wine intake.  Another bad downside is that tannins block the body’s absorption of Iron so it is suggested to drink your tea or coffee after a meal to prevent throwing off your vitamin consumption.  Some people also complained that tannins are associated with migrane headaches but the research so far hasn’t associated any real evidence of that.
</p><p>So to sum up the following article: Tannins are great for your health and can give great qualities to wine and many doctors are recommending a glass a day for many in hopes of improving their cardiovascular health.  More research is needed to find the full effects of tannins in the body so go enjoy a glass of wine and start drinking your way to good health.

That’s right; I am talking about “turkey time”.  This time honored tradition has been celebrated for nearly 400 years.  The turkey, the stuffing, the yams…oh my, but what about the wine?  Many of us get frustrated trying to find the right wine to pair with this wonderful meal.  With all the different foods and flavors, decided which wine will compliment the meal has stumped everyone.  One of the biggest mistakes we make during the holiday is last minute shopping.  One of the first steps to avoiding this dilemma is to pre-plan your meal and wine.  Usually the week before Thanksgiving is the best time to buy your wine.</p><p>  Many people try to find one wine that will carry them through the whole meal but to find a wine that will compliment foods like potatoes, yams, stuffing, cranberries, and pumpkin and pecan pies is hard.  One of the best wines that can pull it off is sparkling wines.  Increasingly popular, sparkling wines bring versatility and elegance to any meal.  From appetizers to dessert, Sparkling wines can achieve a near perfect pairing. </p><p>  If you are into red wines and want to mix it up, you should choose a red wine that isn’t too dry.  A red wine with moderate tannins, that won’t overpower the food.  Wines like Pinot Noirs, Zinfandels can pair nicely.  For white wine lovers, try a nice Viogner, Sauvignon Blancs, etc.  The key to finding a great white wine is well balanced acidity.  This will support the flavors and not overpower and will enhance the meal.  Pinot Grigios, Albarino, Vinho Verde are good choices.  By mixing it up, you will be able to give your company a chance to explore different wines, with different foods.</p><p>  For desserts you might want to pair a nice fortified wine like a tawny port with pumpkin and pecan pies.  Cream sherry is another great choice as well as ice wines and Rieslings to pair with that apple pie. </p><p>  In the end, all that matters is what you prefer and enjoy.  It is a time of sharing and being thankful so take your time and don’t get frustrated.  Just go with what you know and enjoy your fabulous holiday.

But don’t fret because fall is a great time, especially for wine and a time to get prepared for the upcoming holidays.  There are plenty of great recommendations of wine available.  </p><p>One of the major difficulties is to pair wine with autumn food.  When you think of autumn, you think of orange fall leaves, pumpkins, wild mushrooms, apples and squashes.  The idea is to compliment these foods with wines that may share or contrast particular flavors.</p><p>What better way to compliment a nice pork loin with a bacon apple sauce, then to pair it with a nice Chardonnay. </p><p>Rodney Strong Chardonnay Reserve 2008 has a nice full body with flavors of spiced apples, pear joined with a mineral lemon cream and toasty oak on the palate.</p><p>Another great choice if white wine isn’t your choice would be a nice blend.  Red blends will go well with that chicken and wild mushroom recipe you found online.  A nice red blend like Bodega NQN Coleccion 2006 is a nice blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec.  With spicy notes of black cherry and black currant aromas that lead to a complex, elegant savory wine will not only impress the guests but will add that “WOW” factor to your dish.</p><p>If the red blend is too hearty for your taste buds, then you might want to tone it down with a pleasant Pinot Noir.  With succulent raspberry, plum, black cherry fruit aromas with a velvety light styled texture then this is your wine.  </p><p>A nice Pinot Noir will go well with that Crock Pot Roast Beef or any other wild game.  Not too overpowering, a Pinot Noir will compliment the flavors in the gravy and beef.  Gloria Ferrer Carneros Pinot Noir 2007 has a complex, round, mouth filling delicious Pinot Noir.  </p><p>To end the night on the right note, maybe nicely baked apple dumplings baked in nice flaky pastry dough with cinnamon and sugar paired with a nice Riesling. Maybe a nice piece of cake with cream cheese filling will tempt your senses and complimented by a nice fully vibrant Riesling.  </p><p>Next Riesling 2008 is a nice match and easy on the pockets.  Bright highlights with citrus blossom, apricot and hints of lime leaving a clean refreshing accompaniment to your beautifully crafted dessert are heavenly. </p><p>I hope you enjoyed the suggestions and enjoy your fall.

"57";"2";"Which is Drier Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot?";"which-is-drier-cabernet-sauvignon-or-merlot";"0";NULL;"<p>Many people come into the store and are interested in a nice red wine but aren’t too knowledgeable about the varietals and the styles of red Wine.  There are so many varietals and styles of wine to choose from that unless you have some information or knowledge of wine, it could be difficult to find a nice bottle of wine.</p>
<p>Let’s first start with the term dry.  Every wine has Tannins in it which is a polyphenolic compound that binds to proteins.  Plants produce tannins to keep animals from eating their leaves by leaving a bitter astringent taste.  </p>
<p>The good thing about tannins is that they give certain characteristics to wine.  The astringent puckering feeling in red wine is actually the tannins interacting and binding with the proteins in your saliva which give a full bodied or dry feeling in wine, so a dry wine would be a wine with lots of tannins. </p><p>Cabernet Sauvignon has more tannins than Merlot so technically, the Cabernet Sauvignon would be the drier wine of the two.  There are instances where a Merlot can be drier than a Cabernet and it all depends really on the winemaker who produced the wine.  What also determines the dryness of a wine is the harvest time.  </p>
<p>One way to make a sweet wine is to harvest the grapes as late as possible so they could condense their sugars.  As red wine ferments or when the yeast eats up the sugars and leaves the byproduct of alcohol, sometimes if the process is ended early there will be a lot of sugar left in the wine which would make it sweeter.  </p>
<p>If the grapes are harvested early, the grapes will have fewer sugars and more acids, making them dryer.  So there are many factors involved when determining how dry a wine will be. </p>
<p>If you are just starting out, I would go with a nice Merlot.  It is an all around wine that isn’t too dry and isn’t too sweet.  Merlot can be paired with many foods and is really a good bottle of wine.  While the flavor profile is similar to Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot tends to be less distinctive and slightly more herbaceous overall in taste and aroma.  </p>

"58";"2";"​Weddings and Champagne: History & Customs";"weddings-and-champagne";"0";NULL;"<p>There is so much tradition associated between Champagne and Weddings.  Toasting has become second nature with celebrations and special occasions.  From commemorations, retirements, housewarmings, and even launching boats, champagne has been the wine of choice for celebrating.  <br>
</p><p>The history of this beloved drink goes back to Roman times.  They were the first to plant these vines in the Northeastern part of France.  Known before medieval times, Monks would produce Champagne for use in their rituals and sacraments.
</p><p>French kings were traditionally anointed in Reims where this lovely wine was served in coronation ceremonies.  The oldest recorded Sparkling wine was made by Benedictine monk’s in1531 and it was called Blanquette de Limoux.
</p><p>The name was from an English scientist Christopher Merret who documented an additional fermentation from added sugar in a paper he presented to the Royal Society where he named it methode champenoise in 1662.  Great marketing which included copyrighting the name Champagne and creating strict regulations made Champagne popular among the common folk who could “live like a king” or at least drink like one with Champagne.
</p><p>Laurent Perrier boasted in 1890 that Champagne was the favorite among King Leopold of Belgium, George1 of Greece and many other dukes and noble knights.  He gave the image of affordable luxury which led to its association with celebrations.
</p><h2>The Toast</h2><p>There are many mysteries surrounding the origins of the toast.  Some apocryphal stories talk about poisoning and by clicking or touching the glasses together would cause the drink to spill into each other's cup.
</p><p>Other stories include an ancient practice of placing a burnt piece of toast on top of the wine which took away some acidity makes the wine more drinkable.
</p><p>Even in medieval times there was a toasting cup with two handles called Coupe de Mariage which a couple would share during a marriage and a small piece of toast would be placed on the wine to ensure a healthy life.  Raising your glass and saying a few kind words have become customary.
</p><p>Served in long flutes to keep the bubbles fresh and a long stem to keep the wine chilled, weddings and other ceremonies would not be the same without the Champagne.  As always I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it.

"59";"2";"What is a Decanter and Why Should I Use One?";"what-is-a-decanter";"0";NULL;"<p>Decanters have a long history associated with them.  Similar to a carafe, decanters have played an important role in serving wine.  Dating back to the Roman times, decanters were filled with wine from an Amphora, which is a vase like ceramic jug with two handles and served from the table.  The decanters were easier to handle by one person or servant.  glass decanters were pioneered by the Romans but due to limited amount of glass, silver, gold and bronze were used.  The Venetians also used glass decanters during the Renaissance period.  The design style of decanters allowed for more air to interact with the wine.  They usually have a long slender neck and wide body.  In 1730 the British glass makers added a stopper to limit the exposure to air.  The designs haven’t changed much since then.
</p><h2>Multipurpose</h2><p>  Decanters add many factors to their usage.  One of the main reasons was that the Amphora’s contained sediment on the bottom of them from the aging wine and by using a decanter; you can filter out these sediment particles to prevent serving them in a person’s glass.  Not only was filtering a factor but the size and shape of the decanters allowed it easier to pour.
</p><p>  Another factor was that the wine was aerated.  When you aerate a wine and allow it to breathe it mimics the effects of swirling the wine in a glass.  The stimulation and movement of the molecules in wine trigger the release of more aromas.  Aerating is more beneficial to wines containing more tannin and is very tannic in nature.
</p><h2>Debate</h2><p>  Decanting wine and the effectiveness of using a decanter is debatable and many people have mixed reviews.  While many claim that prolonged exposure to air can diffuse a wine more than stimulate, other believe there are  benefits.  Some also believe that although great for very tannic wines, delicate wines like Pinot Noir and Chianti can be harmed through decanting.
</p><p>  In the end it is a matter of opinion.  I personally like the look and feel of the decanters and it adds a little class to the wine serving process.  The aesthetic value of the decanter adds that certain flare to a party or get together.  Decanters aren’t just for wine.  Many use decanters to hold their Single Malt Scotches, Cognacs and Whiskeys.  There are many styles and designs to choose from.

"60";"2";"What is a Full Bodied Wine?";"what-is-a-full-bodied-wine";"0";NULL;"<p>The body of a wine describes the textures or the weight of the wine and how it feels in the mouth.  It is more a feeling that comes from a combination of elements like acidity, glycerol, extract, alcohol, etc. A full bodied wine has a complex well round and rich flavor that lingers in the mouth.  </p><p>Some people describe it as a dry puckering type feeling from the tannins interacting with the saliva in your mouth.  Red wines and white wines can have full bodies.  Some of the red wines associated with full bodies is Cabernet Sauvignon, and French Bordeaux.  Dry whites include Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc. </p><p> Usually aged in wood and aged.  Some dessert wines like Sauternes are considered full bodied because the extra sugar adds weight to the texture.  It is hard to judge the body of a wine since it pertains to ones wine feel because everyone has their own opinions and feelings.  </p><p>Smell, taste, legs, and viscosity can be seen and are more a physical attribute as compared to a feeling like judging the body of a wine.  Some wines that are higher in alcohol can be considered full bodied.</p><p>  To compare it to another product, I will use milk.  A full bodied wine would be similar in texture to cream or half and half, a medium body would be similar to regular milk and a light bodied wine would be like 2% milk which is more watery and thin.</p><p>  There are certain recommendations on what foods go well with wine.  This is not an exact science but could help bring out the flavors of your meal.  An overpowering wine will ruin the food is not properly paired. </p><p> The general rule is Full bodied wines should pair well with hearty meats, steak, beef, heavy pastas, etc.  If the meal is big and hearty then the wine should be as well. </p><p> If you want to have a salad or some seafood, something light then a good light bodied wine will help bring out the flavors of the meal.  I remember having a nice Vinho Verde with a salad and it made the green bell pepper so lively and it tasted so intense from the wine complimenting the flavor. </p><p> The best way to learn about body is to try different wines.  Find the differences between mouth feel and you will be able to determine the body of the wine.

"61";"2";"What is Noble Rot?";"what-is-noble-rot";"0";NULL;"<p>Botrytis Cinerea or also known by the name Noble Rot is a form of grey fungus which grows on certain types of fruits.
</p><p>This fungus is brought on by moist, wet conditions, at which point is known as Grey Rot. The Noble Rot fungus sometimes actually helps wine in producing a sweeter wine.  Grapes usually become infected when they are ripe.  Once infected and exposed to drier conditions, the grapes become raisined and this is known as Noble Rot. Some wine producers use this technique purposely to produce sweeter wines.
</p><p>  The origin of using infected grapes can date back to around 1570 but the vineyard classifications began in 1730 in the Tokaj region in Southeastern Slovakia.  Many crops are lost to Grey Rot but many distinctive sweet dessert wines like Tokay, Tokaji, Aszu, and Sauternes are among those produced from the Noble Rot grapes.
</p><p>  The name Botrytis cinera comes from Latin and translates to “Grapes like ashes” which is in reference to their color.  The fungus removes water from the grapes leaving high amounts of sugars, acids, and minerals.  The more concentrated the  product is the more intense flavors it has.  Besides grapes, Noble Rot affects many other plants like strawberries, tomatoes, etc.
</p><p>  It has been shown that field workers who pick the Noble Rot grapes can be subjected to a rare form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (winegrower’s lung).
</p><h2>Popular myths</h2><p>  There are many stories behind the practice of making wine from Noble Rot which include a story about a Riesling producer at Schloss Johannisberg in the Rheingau region who awaited the approval of the estate owner before cutting the grapes.  The owner was Heinrich von Bibra, bishop of Fulda and he sent his abbey to give the message to harvest but was robbed en route to deliver the message and so the harvest was lost to the rot and given to the peasants who made a sweet delicious wine from these grapes known as Spatlese or “late harvest” wine.

"62";"2";"What Wine is Good to use for Cooking?";"cooking-wine";"0";NULL;"<p>I remember my mom always telling me that if you can’t drink the wine then don’t cook with it.  It is funny because I am reminded of her sayings every time I go to the supermarket and see the five dollar bottles of wine in the beer section.  I think this saying which is used by many has some truth to it.  One of the facts to remember is that when you add wine to a pan, the only thing that cooks out is the alcohol.  The flavor of the wine is still in the dish so it would be wise to pick some thing worth drinking.  The cheap cooking wines you often find in the supermarket and sometimes the dollar store actually have a lot of sodium which could be bad for your diet.
</p><h2>The unknown rules for cooking</h2><p>  One thing you should do is to think of wine as an ingredient that plays some importance as the other ingredients.  For instance, you aren’t going to use an artificial cheese or powder for your mac and cheese recipe and so the same consideration should be taken with the wine. </p><p> It isn’t wise to use a really expensive wine but you shouldn’t use a really cheap wine that might spoil your meal.  There are some average wines that are priced reasonably and are descent to cook with.  Now the main thing to remember and most important is to have fun.  Experiment with different varietals. </p><p> A little chardonnay in the chicken alfredo or a dash of Cabernet Sauvignon in the lasagna sauce.  Choosing a wine is similar to food pairing in that a light bodied wine should be used for light dishes and a dry heavy wine should be used for hearty heavy meals. </p><p> Red wines are good for pasta dishes, sauces, and red meats.  White wines are gooood  for cream sauces or with poultry and seafood dishes.  I usually recommend a dry white wine because the flavors or sweetness of the wine might counteract with the seasonings in the dish so to play it safe, I use a nice dry base to start out with. </p><p> If you use a wine in your recipe than your wine that you will serve with the food should be the same varietal.  So if you make an Alfredo sauce with Chardonnay, then you don’t want to serve a Cabernet Sauvignon with it.
</p><p>  You don’t have to spend a ton of money on a wine that you are just going splash in your dish and always experiment.  The different characteristics of wine can enhance and add character to your food.  Have fun and enjoy and save the expensive wines to serve with the food and not in it.  As always enjoy!!!

"63";"2";"Where do I find Wine Recommendations?";"where-do-i-find-wine-recommendations";"0";NULL;"<p>Besides learning the wine lingo and learning how to taste wine, it is not uncommon for many new wine drinkers to ask where to find good wine recommendations.  As vast as the wine industry is, there is a good answer for that.  There are many blogs as well as fun and interesting comments on wine on the internet.  Some of the advice you receive online is sometimes inconsistent so one of my recommendations is to check out reputable wine publications.  There are some major magazines and online sites that have accurate descriptions and even a rating system.</p><p>  Wine spectator was founded first as a tabloid newspaper in 1976.  Created by Bob Morrisey, it was later sold to the current publisher Marvin R. Shanken.  It was around 1981 when they created the Restaurant Award Program that reviewed restaurants and rated them in three categories. It publishes 15 issues per year and includes articles, tasting notes, and wine ratings.</p><p>  The Wine Advocate was created by Robert M. Parker Jr. and publishes bimonthly.  The first issue was published in 1978 and was originally called The Baltimore-Washington Wine Advocate.  Robert Parker introduced a Point quality scale which had a major impact on the wine industry.  Robert M. Parker originally studied law until 1984 when his publication made enough money for him to quit.  He gained international popularity when he predicted that a 1982 Bordeaux wine was highly rated.</p><p>  Wine Enthusiast is another great publication created in 1988 by Adam and Sybil Strum.  Reaching 680,000 readers with great wine and spirit reviews as well as additional wine lifestyle content, Wine Enthusiast also has a website with great wine information.</p><p>These are some of the major players in rating and recommending wine.  All the publications not only give you great recommendations but also have articles describing tastes and characteristics of grape varietals.  Check them out online or pick up the magazine from your local newsstand and enjoy.  </p><p>Further Reading: <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/cooking-wine.html"">What Wines are Good to Use for Cooking?</a></p><p>Learn more about our wines and spirits <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/"">here</a>.</p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"Where do I find Wine Recommendations?";NULL;"Besides learning the wine lingo and learning how to taste wine, it is not uncommon for many new wine drinkers to ask where to find good wine recommendations.

"64";"2";"Which is Drier, Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio? ";"which-is-drier-chardonnay-or-pinot-grigio";"0";NULL;"<p>White wine is generally labeled into two categories labeled dry or sweet.  To answer a question of which white wine is drier is very hard to answer due to the complexity and characteristics of the wines.  Dry wines tend to have more complex flavors, higher alcohol, and less acidity than sweet wines.  To explore the answer more in depth, we must define the characteristics of each varietal.
</p><h2>Pinot Grigio</h2><p>  Pinot Grigio is also found by the name Pinot Gris sometimes.  This wine is generally light and crisp and usually paired with simple light meals.  Some Pinot Grigio’s are very dry with hints of natural citrus and apple flavors.  Pinot Gris grapes mature early and thrive in cool climates.  Now how dry this wine is depends on the region and wine making style.  This is where the answer gets a little tricky.  While some Pinot Grigio’s appear to be drier due to fermentation and are high in alcohol, others may appear sweeter due to early maturation with higher sugar levels.  So depending on the region and it is possible to have a Pinot Grigio that seems a bit sweeter.
</p><h2>Chardonnay</h2><p>  Chardonnay is a very neutral grape and the flavors it most commonly have are from the influences of Oak and Terroir. Many of the North American Chardonnays appear to have more Oak and vanilla hints than their French counterparts. This hint of vanilla and the oak can make the Chardonnay have a buttery, nutty feel to it which people may generally mistaken for sweetness.  Chardonnay is world renown for being added to champagnes and many white burgundys out of France.
</p><p>  So the matter is that since they are both dry then which one is drier?  That is why it is hard to answer but in general, Chardonnay is the drier of the two although it is possible to have a Pinot Grigio that may be dry as well.
</p><p>I think the best way to decide is to pair it with food.  Chardonnays are great with heavy hearty meals while Pinot Grigio’s are great with light dishes and seafood.  So hopefully this article helps a little.  As always,drink well my friends.

I use to wonder why wine didn’t come in clear bottles so we can see how good it looks. Sometimes you can tell if a white wine is bad by the darkness of it as compared to other bottles.  </p><p>So I did a little research and found out many interesting things about the color of the bottle.  There is a reason why they recommend a wine cellar or cave to store your wine bottles and that is because the conditions are cool and dark.  </p><p>Most colored bottles have UV filters that prevent the sunlight from degrading and prematurely aging your wine.  You will find a majority of red wines come in colored bottles for this reason. </p><p> Now many of the colored bottles are produced from tradition and so they follow the colors that have always been used.  No matter what color the bottle is, test has proven that a darker bottle helps protect the degradation. </p><p> I believe you can find a similar argument with beer as well.  Many of the bottles have distinct shapes for the style of wine they are. It is pretty easy to determine the style of wine and where it originated just from the shape and color of the bottle. </p><p>So I hope this is as informative as it was to write it.

I use to wonder why Rieslings almost always can in a long slender type bottle.  Most bottles hold bout 750ml of wine that is generally made from glass.  Some of the wines are fermented in the bottle while others are bottled after fermentation and all of them used to be sealed with a cork.  Screw cap tops are becoming more popular as well and in the U.S. many bottles are referred to as a “fifth” until 1979 when the U.S. adopted the metric system and 750ml took its place.Shapes</p><p>  Wine producers from old traditional countries stick to their traditions and choose the shape of their bottles from a long history of bottle shapes that their forefathers made.  Some of the bottles have weird names derived from historical references.</p><p>Punts are also called kick ups which is a dimple at the bottom of the wine bottle.  The purpose for the dimple doesn’t have an exact purpose but many suggest that when the glass bottles were blown that the technique left a mark on the bottom of the bottle and by indenting the bottom, glass blowers were able to not leave a mark that could scratch the table.  </p><p>Others believe it made the bottle less likely to topple over.  It also provides a grip for pourers as well as allows the bottles to be more easily stacked.  Tavern servants used to put their thumb in the dimple to show the barkeep whether the customer was a thumbs up or thumbs down as a reliable patron.  Whatever the reasons, it was the common shape and is still used today.</p><p>  Champagne bottles are actually made of a thicker glass due to the carbonation in the bottle.  Dom Perignon was one of the first producers to include a wire mesh to prevent the cork from flying off and hitting some one. </p><p>  Mosel and Alsace bottles tend to be slim and tall with narrow sides usually a green glass that often contained sweet dessert wines or a dry- off dry wine.</p><p>  Most of the wine producers shaped their bottles according to the style.  If a wine had similar characteristics to Bordeaux then it would be placed in a bottle similar in shape and style.  Fortified wines like port and sherry are usually bottled in a sturdy bottle with a bulge in the neck which was to catch the sediment from fortification.  </p><p>You can usually determine the style and origin of the wine from the shape and color of the bottle.  You will notice and will soon be able to distinguish between the bottles and could know what regions they are from.  As always my friends, I hope this article helps you pick out that wine you like.

Since the beginning of history, wine has been transported in everything from wooden barrels, clay amphoras, exotic animal skins and etc.  In recent times, innovative improvements on non glass containers have made it possible to replace our beloved glass bottles.  One of the newest inventions making a come up since it hit the market has been the pet bottles.  Pet bottles have been used in the past with small 25cl bottles and the 1.5 bottle from the south of France.  Some of the popularity behind these containers is associated with reducing our carbon footprint.
</p><p>  Some of the advantages in using these bottles are that they are lighter.  A pet bottle weighs 54 grams as compared to the 400 gram glass bottle.  These bottles are also easy to transport and are recyclable.  More bottles can be stored during transport which helps the carbon footprint.
</p><p>  Some of the disadvantages associated include a shorter shelf life due to the allowance of oxygen inside the bottle.  Plastic bottles have always been frowned upon as cheap.  Another fear is that plastic bottles may contain phthalates which can be harmful to the body and might be absorbed in the body.
</p><p>  So it is hard to tell if these plastic bottles will replace glass especially with people and the image of plastic containing wine. Glass has always given wine that elegant feel and superb classiness.  Would you buy a plastic bottle of wine bottle?   Only time will tell if plastic wins the battle of the bottles.

"68";"2";"Wine Accessories: What You Need to Know";"wine-accessories-what-you-need-to-know";"0";NULL;"<p>Ok so you have a few bottles in your collection.  Maybe you put a few bottles aside for that special occasion when company comes over.  You find yourself in front of your local wine store looking at some of the accessories for wine but are confused at what does what.  This article is for you to try to help explain some of the items you might want to add to your collection.  Names like aerators, decanters, and other oddly shaped tools can be a little intimidating, especially if you have no clue what they do.  Let’s start with why we might need them.</p><p>  Aerators are very cool and I kind of look at them as helpers.  They help the wine breath by displacing the wine and allowing oxygen to the mix.  They make very significant changes that are very noticeable.  If you ever see someone twirling their wine in their glass, it is because they are trying to aerate it to bring out the flavors and aromas. </p><p>  Aerators are designed in a way similar to carburetors which mix oxygen and fuel.  They have a wide tube that narrows at one end and they work faster than decanters.</p><p>  Decanters are made of glass, ceramic or metals like gold, copper, silver, etc. and are used to aerate the wine as well.  They do this because of the way they are shaped which allows for a big surface area in the vessel to which the wine can breathe.  Most can hold about one bottle and besides aerating the wine they also have a nice look to them that add a certain aesthetic to parties and even your wine collection.  Decanters are different from amphoras which were big jugs that wine was stored in.  Usually with handles on both sides and often wine was poured from amphoras into decanters which were smaller and easier to handle.  Another benefit of this method was that they were able to keep the sediment on the bottom of the wine from being poured into someone’s glass.</p><p>  A wine vacuum sealer is a little gadget that can help when you don’t want to finish a bottle of wine.  Many people usually put a cork in the bottle and leave it but the air inside will gradually reduce the quality of the wine.  This could affect the wine if you don’t drink the wine for a couple of days.  If you know you aren’t going to finish the bottle within the week then you could benefit from a vacuum sealer. </p><p>  You should have some knowledge on corkscrews.  They are pretty self explanatory.  You might hear references to a device called the rabbit which is a cork screw that attaches to a table and has the shape of rabbit ears.  Besides that you should always use the right glasses to help bring the taste out of your wine.</p><p>  I never thought that there were so many details in the gadgets used with wine until I started trying some.  They do make a difference and you should try some of these gadgets in your house.  You can find reasonably priced items at your local wine store or even online at <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/"">TheLiquorStore.com</a>.  So pick some up today and let me know what you think.</p><p>Further reading: <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/will-glass-wine-bottles-be-replaced.html"">Will Glass Wine Bottles be Replaced?</a><a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/will-glass-wine-bottles-be-replaced.html""></a></p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"Wine Accessories: What You Need to Know";NULL;"Ok so you have a few bottles in your collection.

"69";"2";"Wine Aging: For Taste, Quality, & Science";"wine-aging";"0";NULL;"<p>When I first got into enjoying wine, I often wondered about starting my own collection of good bottles but wasn’t sure about how the aging of wine worked.  Not all bottles can be stored away for years and many have a very short shelf life.  There is a science behind aging and once you know the facts behind, you can start working on your collection.</p><p>  The aging of wine can improve taste and quality.  Although wine is perishable, the sugars, acids, compounds, and tannins can alter and make the wine more pleasurable.  The ratio of all of these ingredients is important to determining what wines age well.  Only 10% of the wine produced has the ability to age.  </p><p>The majority of wine is meant to be consumed in a few years.  I think the first step to aging wine would be to get a storage rack with proper conditions.  Proper conditions can include a dark, damp and quiet space where you wine will not be exposed to vibrations.  Never store red wine in the refrigerator because with little humidity, the corks will shrink and your wine will spoil.  It is also important to store sideways or upside down to keep the cork moist.  If the cork dries out it could spoil the wine. </p><p> The science and qualities needed to determine which wines age can be a little difficult.  Most wines with lots of tannins have a great aging ability.  Tannins are a type of astringent which binds with proteins.  These polyphenolic compounds are found in plant leaves to add a bitter taste to the leaves to prevent animals from eating it.  These tannins are actually quite beneficial to wine.  They give the wine body.  The puckering feeling in dry red wine is the tannins binding with the proteins in your saliva.  These tannins break down as time passes and become sediment in the bottom of the bottle.  During this process, the wine becomes smoother and the color becomes a more brick, rusty color.</p><p>  Wines with a low PH also have a greater capability of aging.  In white wine sugar acts like tannins and preserves the wine.  The white wines with the longest aging ability seem to be the ones with high amounts of extract and acidity as well as less water.  The less water in the grape prior to harvest, the more likely the grapes will have aging potential.</p><p>  Each wine has its own aging potential.  There is a point at which the wine is ready to drink.  It is possible to over age and hold on to a bottle for too long. </p><p>  Vintage sometimes plays a role in determining the aging ability of a wine.  Climate and temperature plays an important role.  There are vintage charts that explain which regions had a great year for wine.  The factors in determining a good year could be rainfall, whether or not there was extreme heat or extreme cold.  The harvesting time as well play an important role.</p><p>Once you know the style and are able to store it properly than you will be on your way to having a great collection.</p><p>Further reading: <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/wine-accessories-what-you-need-to-know.html"">Wine Accessories: What You Need to Know</a><a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/wine-accessories-what-you-need-to-know.html""></a></p><p>Learn more about our wines and spirits <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/"">here</a>.</p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"Wine Aging: For Taste, Quality, & Science";NULL;"When I first got into enjoying wine, I often wondered about starting my own collection of good bottles but wasn’t sure about how the aging of wine worked.

"70";"2";"Wine Lingo - Can You Speak It?";"wine-lingo";"0";NULL;"<p>Many of the words used to describe how a wine is can be confusing at times, with terms like bouquets’ and lingering finishes; one might think they are going to a long wedding reception.  Learning the “lingo” of wine is one of the first steps to take on your way to becoming a wine connoisseur.  Increasing your vocabulary and knowledge can help you not only impress your friends and colleagues but also make sense of what your tasting.  I have listed some of the words frequently used but you might encounter more that aren’t listed along your journey of wine tasting.
</p><p><b>Acidity-</b> This doesn’t mean the flesh burning liquid in the sci-fi movies but actually the acidity of the grape.  Every fruit has a level of acidity and this can be important in a wine.  A good balance of sugar, acidity, color, etc., can make for a great wine.
</p><p><b>Astringency-</b> This is how much a wine makes you get that puckering feeling sometimes associated with dryness.  Astringency comes from how much tannins are present in the wine.
</p><p><b>Appellation of Origin-</b> This is a term used for the region where the grapes came from to make the wine.  Some wineries may get their grapes from nearby regions and the appellation would let you know where they originated.  Some appellations can be regions, states, countries or geographical areas. Some laws state a certain percentage of grapes must originate from a certain area in order to be labeled properly.
</p><p><b>Balance-</b> The balance of a wine are how all the elements are working together, Acidity, sweetness, tannins, alcohol, if harmonious together can create a good wine with great balance.
</p><p><b>D.O.C.G/D.O.C-</b> D.O.C. and D.O.C.G. are abbreviations for the regulations of wine.  These terms state and let the consumer know that the wine was grown and produced within a certain region, with a certain varietal, certain methods, etc.  Usually these classifications are from a committee of appointed wine producers and government regulations that protect the quality of the wine being produced.
</p><p><b>Legs-</b> Don’t worry, your wine is going to run away.  Legs are when you swirl a wine around and see a delay of wine that creeps slowly down the glass.This is described as legs.  The higher the alcohol, the thinner the legs and the opposite for lower alcohol levels when determining whether your wine has legs.
</p><p><b>Mouthfeel-</b> This term describes the sensations you get in your mouth sometimes described as thin or thick when you taste a wine.
</p><p><b>Sommelier-</b> This lovely word that flows off the tongue is a French word for an educated person who assists you in choosing your wine from the menu.  This wine steward should be knowledgeable in food pairings with wine.
</p><p><b>Varietal-</b> This is the term for the type of grape.  A Cabernet Sauvignon is a grape varietal.  Most New World Wines are labeled with their grape varietal while some wines are labeled with terroir which is region.
</p><p><b>Terroir-</b> This word comes from the word for land “terre”.  It is a French word that describes an area.  Some wines are labeled with their terroir which are similar to characteristics. So if Bordeaux is dry and deep red then other wines with similar characteristics from a certain geological area can be labeled as Bordeaux.  It describes how the wine is as compared to the grapes used in the wine.
</p><p><b>Finish-</b> The overall taste that remains in your mouth after you swallowed your glass of wine is considered the finish.  Full bodied wines have long finishes and light bodied wines have short finishes.  The finish is actually the tannins of the wine interacting with the proteins in your saliva.  So the more tannins, the longer the finish and the less tannins, the shorter the finish and length of pleasant aftertaste is present in the wine.
</p><p><b>Bouquet-</b> This is a term used to describe the aroma or the smells of the wine that change
</p><p>during the course of the wines aging.
</p><p><b>Brut-</b> This term is applied to many Champagnes and sparkling wines which is a term used to describe the dryness of the wine.
</p><p>These are just a few terms you might run across when you go to wine tastings or if a friend is describing a wine to you.  These terms will help you explain to others why a wine is good or bad.  So try it for yourself and throw some of these words around in your next wine conversation and see how well you can impress your friends.  To end this article with a corny saying, I will say “now you know” and “knowing is half the battle”.  As always enjoy good friends, good food, and great wine. Enjoy!!!

Living in the city makes it quite difficult to find space to store our wine collections.  After you racked up a few bottles it might be beneficial to invest in a wine refrigerator, unless of course you own acres of land and have the ability to put your wine in the cellar.  </p><p>There are many things to consider when searching out a wine refrigerator.  With today’s innovations, there are so many options to choose from.  Many of today’s wine refrigerators offer air circulation and humidity controls with specially treated glass to maintain constant temperature.  Wine refrigerators are so different from a regular refrigerator with tons more options that are impressive. Even the outside décor comes in many options like woods and or other decorative materials that will help match you wine refrigerator to any kitchen style.</p><p>  Another thing to decide is how many bottles you would like to hold in your refrigerator.  The rule is always bigger is better.  You might not think you need the extra room but soon your collection will grow and that extra space will come in handy. </p><p>  Wine refrigerators come in all different sizes, from table top to custom fully built modules.  Companies like Eurocave offer great designs at reasonable pricing.  There are even budget wine refrigerators at your local shopping mall.</p><p>  Like many, you probably think you can get away with throwing a wine in the refrigerator to chill it so you don’t need to invest in a wine refrigerator.  The problem with that is that your normal refrigerator is too cold to store wine in.  If you chill your white wine too much, it will kill the aromas and flavors of the wine.  You want to serve your wine at an appropriate temperature to get the most out of your investments.    </p><p>Further Reading: <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/wine-lingo.html"">Wine Lingo - Can You Speak It?</a><a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/blog/wine-lingo.html""></a></p><p>Learn more about our wines and spirits <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/"">here</a>.</p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;"Wine Refrigerators - A Practical Buyer's Guide";NULL;"With so many people becoming wine connoisseurs and interested in all different types of wine, storage becomes an issue.

Many people associate jug wines with inexpensive or cheap.  These bargain priced wines aren’t really that bad in quality and are ideal for parties and events.  One of the major companies that you will find selling jug wines is Carlos Rossi and Opici wines.  In the late 1980’s, jug wines started labeling varietals to meet customer demand.  These jug wines come in a variety of sizes like 3 liter, 4 liter, and also 5 liter box wines.</p><p>  A jug is a type of container used to hold liquid with a handle and a spout used to pour or drink.  Most jugs are made of clay, glass, and plastic.  Native Americans made jugs by sealing the inside of woven baskets with a material called asphaltum.  An empty jug was sometimes used in American folklore music as an instrument. </p><p> A variety of amusing jugs like the puzzle jug and the Toby jug were made to amuse and entertain bar patrons.  One of the earliest examples is the Exeter puzzle jug which had many holes in the top of the jug and the goal was to drink the liquid inside without spilling any.  The Exeter puzzle jug has a long history dating back to around 1300AD.  These jugs were decorated with inscriptions like “fill me up with licker sweet for it is good when fun us do meet”. </p><p>  Another type of jug is the Toby Jug, also known as a Fillpot.

"73";"2";" Tips to Buying the Right Wine Gift ";"tips-to-buying-the-right-wine-gift";"0";NULL;"<p>As the holidays roll around we often find ourselves asking the age old question year after year, “What wine should I give as a gift?” With the vast selection of wines to choose from, we often get flustered and worrying more about our choices than the intentions of our actions.  There are a few tips to follow to help you choose the right gift.</p><p>  One of the first things to do is to figure out how much you would like to spend.  This is where people get intimidated.  Many believe in the age old myth of “if it costs more, then it must be a good wine.”  This is so far from the truth and you should realize that cost doesn’t always reflect quality.  It is possible to find a great wine in any price range.  Besides that, the whole purpose of buying someone wine is to show your appreciation and the wine is meant to be enjoyed. </p><p>  The next step is to decide what type of wine you would like to buy for that special someone.  This is probably the hardest part and unless you know what style of wine the recipient likes, then it can be very challenging.  The styles of wines range from dry to sweet, red to white, new world to old world, etc.</p><p>  One thing you should always keep in mind is to enjoy yourself when your shopping and don’t be afraid to ask questions.  If you go to the right store, then the salesperson should be knowledgeable and should recommend some really good choices.  If you are buying wine before going to a friend’s house for dinner, then you should consider the type of foods being served.  Also do a little research online or from major wine publications such as Wine Spectator, Wine Advocate and the Wine Enthusiast.  These magazines are pretty helpful with rating systems and accurate descriptions of many of the wines that are popular and in you local stores.</p><p>  Wrapping your gift puts a personal touch on your wine selection.  There are many nice and affordable custom made bags for wine bottles.  Bows and wrapping also shows the recipient that you put some time and effort into the gift.  So hopefully this article will help you and always remember to enjoy yourself.</p><p>Browse more of our wines and spirits <a href=""https://theliquorstore.com/"">here</a>.</p>";"gitka gitka";NULL;NULL;NULL;" Tips to Buying the Right Wine Gift ";NULL;"As the holidays roll around we often find ourselves asking the age old question year after year, “What wine should I give as a gift?” With the vast selection of wines to choose from, we often get";"2019-06-17 05:33:37";"2019-06-17 05:33:37";"2019-11-04 16:32:00";"0000-00-00 00:00:00";"1";"0";"0";"1";"44";NULL;NULL;NULL;"w1";NULL
"74";"2";"Ready Made Cocktails";"ready-made-cocktails";"0";NULL;"<p>Some of the more popular mixed drinks that were only found in bars are now readily available and pre made in your local wine and spirit store.  I remember many memories of standing by the blender trying to figure out what ingredients were used in many of the drinks I ordered in the bar.  Unfortunately I usually ended up with something purple and  green super strong with alcohol, a horrible mix which always got poured down the drain.  Luckily for me and probably anyone else who tried to experiment in their kitchen with their favorite liqueurs, they have pre made, pour and serve drinks.
</p><h2>Many Varieties Available</h2><p>  Many of the mainstream varieties like Margarita, and Mojito are available.  Many companies offer their version of this popular drink.  Jose Cuervo make a few different ones like Golden Margarita which is one of my favorites because it is not overly sour and the balance between the tequila and the mix are great. Chi-Chi makes a popular Margarita as well.  The new trend is the “Skinny Margarita” which is made for those calorie counters who worry about eating and drinking healthier.  The Skinny Margarita was made popular by a TV show which hosted housewives who lived extravagant lives.  The end result of the popularity of the show resulted in the creation of Skinny Girl Margarita.  There are Mojito mixes as well which has just the right amount of lime and all you need is some ice or just chill the bottle and enjoy it during those hot days of summer.
</p><p> For those who enjoy creamy drinks, there are also a variety of pre mixed cocktails like Pina Colada and Mudslides.  TGIF mixes branded after the popular restaurant makes a wonderful chocolatey Mudslide that will tame any sweet craving.  I know I use to always mess up the amount of alcohol I would add to Pina Colada that I was given the knickname “heavy hands” I am grateful for these ready made cocktails and find it really convenient when it comes to having a party.  A few of these different types, some ice and I’m ready to go.  Bacardi makes a Strawberry Daiquiri which is incredible.  There are ready made cocktails like Rum Runner, Mai Tai, Tuscan lemonade, Mexican mudslide,Long island iced Teas’s, as well as Sweet Teas which are the trend this year.
</p><h2>Convenience</h2><p>  You can find these mixers just about anywhere.  Even your local supermarkets have these mixers available and the best part is that they are very affordable. So next time you are having company or a BBQ or some get together, just buy these easy to make time saving mixers and your friends will appreciate it.  It worked for me because I am now free from being called “Heavy Hands” and everyone loves my parties.
