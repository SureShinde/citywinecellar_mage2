But there&rsquo;s a lot you don&rsquo;t know about bourbon. Next time you take a long pull of your favorite make, ruminate on these interesting tidbits.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.0em;"">1. It Is the Most Strictly Regulated Spirit In the US</span></h2>
The strict regulations that govern bourbon distillation are what account for its unique qualities and what make it the purest form of whiskey. In order to be labeled as bourbon, whiskey must be made from a mash that contains at least 51 percent corn &mdash; the rest can be barley, wheat or rye. The law stipulates that bourbon mash be distilled at 160 proof and barreled at 125 proof without additives of any kind. Crucially, the bourbon must be aged in a new charred oak barrel. The charring on the inside of the barrel is what gives it its flavor. Because the barrels used to age bourbon can&rsquo;t be reused, <a onclick=""javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.kentuckybarrels.com']);"" href=""http://www.kentuckybarrels.com/wholebarrels.html"">bourbon distilleries often sell them</a> to other distilleries, where they&rsquo;re used to make Irish and Scotch whisky.</li>
<li>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.0em;"">2. Bourbon Distilleries Aren&rsquo;t Always in Kentucky</span></h2>
Though bourbon does originate from Bourbon County, Kentucky and most of the major manufacturers of this whiskey are located there, bourbon doesn&rsquo;t need to be made in Kentucky in order to be considered bourbon. Distilleries throughout the United States are free to make bourbon, as long as they use the distillation process laid forth in the Federal Standards of Identity for Bourbon, discussed above. All bourbon must, however, be made in the United States.</li>
<li>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.0em;"">3. The Name Might Come From the Street &mdash; Not the Other Way Around</span></h2>
Most people assume that bourbon gets its name from Bourbon County, Kentucky, where it was originally <a onclick=""javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://mentalfloss.com']);"" href=""http://mentalfloss.com/article/18839/what-makes-whiskey-bourbon-and-other-bourbon-faqs"">invented by Elijah Craig</a>, the first person to age corn whiskey in charred oak barrels in 1789. While this might be the case, some historians believe that it actually takes its name from Bourbon Street in New Orleans, where Kentucky distillers were most likely to sell their corn whiskey in frontier days.<a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/casks-of-Bourbon.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1226"" style=""float: left;"" alt=""Casks of Bourbon"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/casks-of-Bourbon-300x199.jpg"" height=""199"" width=""300"" /></a></li>
<li>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.0em;"">4. Climate Influences Bourbon&rsquo;s Taste</span></h2>
Kentucky bourbon is said to age much faster than Scotch and Irish whisky because the climate in Kentucky is so much hotter than the climate in Ireland and Scotland. Variations in the weather and temperature at which bourbon is aged can have a massive influence on the taste of the final product. Barrels that are aged in hotter weather &mdash; or even on the upper floors of the rick houses where whiskey barrels are stored &mdash; tend to have a sweeter, richer flavor.<br /> When a tornado struck Buffalo Trace Distillery in Frankfort, Kentucky in 2006, numerous barrels of whiskey were left exposed to the elements for months. When tapped, they were <a onclick=""javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.theatlantic.com']);"" href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-new-science-of-old-whiskey/309522/"">found to have a superior flavor</a> to their counterparts that had not been left exposed.</li>
<li>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.0em;"">5. Bourbon Distilleries Produced Penicillin During WWII</span></h2>
When World War II broke out, the nation&rsquo;s distilleries were pressed into service making fuel alcohol and penicillin. Penicillin, which was newly discovered at the time, is made via fermentation, so only distilleries were able to create it in the massive quantities necessary for the war effort.</li>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need to have a huge wine cellar and a heap of spare cash on hand in order to build an impressive wine collection. As any wine collector can tell you, collecting wine isn&rsquo;t about acquiring status symbols or showing off; it&rsquo;s about enjoying the wines you love at various stages during their lifetimes. If you want to start a wine collection but you&rsquo;re on a budget, never fear; you can start a fine collection with just a few hundred dollars, and add to it slowly over the years.</p>
<h2>Find a Place to Store Your Wine</h2>
<p>Collectors who buy investment wines &mdash; wines that will grow in value over the years until they can be sold for a profit<a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/accessories.html""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1233"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/wine-rack-300x219.jpg"" alt=""wine rack"" width=""300"" height=""219"" /></a> &mdash; typically rent space in a wine storage facility where their purchases can be looked after by professionals. The casual collector storing wine for his or her own personal enjoyment doesn&rsquo;t need to go that far, unless, of course, he or she lacks space at home.</p>
<p>You can store your wine collection in the basement, in a closet, or even in a kitchen cupboard &mdash; any place sheltered from heat, light and vibrations will do. If you plan to age some of your wines for years, you should store them in a wine refrigerator. Ideally, wine should be kept <a onclick=""javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://online.wsj.com']);"" href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303532704579477013165798196?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303532704579477013165798196.html"">between 50 and 59 degrees Fahrenheit</a>, although it can be allowed to get as warm as 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Extreme heat or cold as well as wild fluctuations in temperature can harm your wine.</p>
<p>Wine bottles should be stored on their sides so the cork doesn&rsquo;t dry out and deteriorate, spoiling the wine. Don&rsquo;t move the bottles around too much in storage, especially if you&rsquo;re aging them for a long time. Keep your wine in a mildly humid environment where they&rsquo;re sheltered from natural light &mdash; a windowless basement room is ideal.</p>
<h2>Set a Budget</h2>
<p>As with any hobby, it&rsquo;s not always easy to decide how much you should spend on wine for your collection. But if you&rsquo;re on a budget, you&rsquo;ll be happy to know that you can get some good bottles of wine for around $25 to $30 apiece. You can often get good deals on wine &ldquo;futures&rdquo; from your favorites wineries. If you go this route, you&rsquo;ll be buying bottles from vintages that have yet to be bottled, so you&rsquo;ll be taking a chance. You can also get good get deals on end-of-vintage sales, though again, you&rsquo;ll be taking a chance. If you&rsquo;re on a budget, your best bet is to <a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/"">shop discount wine retailers</a>.</p>
<h2>Buy Wines You Like</h2>
<p>For the casual collector, the whole point of a wine collection is to buy wines you&rsquo;ll enjoy drinking later. Though you may want to add a few exquisite &ldquo;trophy&rdquo; wines to your collection, you&rsquo;ll mostly want to stick to buying wines that you&rsquo;ve already tasted or <a onclick=""javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://vintagechart.us']);"" href=""http://vintagechart.us/"">vintages from wineries</a> that you know you&rsquo;ll enjoy. When you find a wine you like, order a <a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/wine-shelf.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1234"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/wine-shelf-300x200.jpg"" alt=""wine shelf"" width=""300"" height=""200"" /></a>case or as many bottles as you can afford. That way, if you open a bottle and find it has not aged enough, you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to try it again a little later. If your budget won&rsquo;t allow you to buy a whole case, you might get a mixed case for a discount; or you could even just buy a bottle or two when you can afford it.</p>

"3";"Wine and Cheese: The Perfect Pair";"<h1>Pairing Wine with Cheese</h1>
<p>Everyone knows that wine and cheese have a long history together. For many, a meal just isn&rsquo;t a meal without a cheese course paired with the perfect wine. While the thought of creating the perfect combination might be daunting for some, it does not have to be.</p>
<p>We have favorite wines, and we have favorite cheeses, and we love to combine them. We&rsquo;ll discuss a few of the most popular cheeses and look at the wines that complement them best. Before you know it, you&rsquo;ll be an expert.</p>
<h2>Bleu Cheese</h2>
<p>Bleu cheese is one of the most assertive cheeses available, but it&rsquo;s also one of the most popular. Bleu cheeses often have a number of different tastes simultaneously, and these can be salty, sweet, bitter and tangy.</p>
<p>Bleu cheese pairs best with a sweet wine that will offset the sharp flavor and complement the natural sweetness of the cheese. We love the Fonseca 10 Year Tawny Port with bleu cheese as the acidity and richness of this port highlights <a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Cheese-plate-with-crackers.jpg""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1244"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Cheese-plate-with-crackers-300x198.jpg"" alt=""Cheese plate with crackers"" width=""300"" height=""198"" /></a>the salt and acid flavors of the cheese perfectly.</p>
<h2>Cheddar</h2>
<p>Many people might view cheddar as a fairly mundane cheese that lacks some of the character that is abundantly present in other, more elegant types of cheese. The truth is that cheddar is a rich and complex cheese that deserves more credit.</p>
<p>As cheddar is a mature cheese with a great deal of robust flavor, it calls for a wine that can stand up to it. Red zinfandels or cabernet sauvignons are best. We love the Earthquake Zinfandel from California, as its strong berry notes complement the intense flavor of the cheddar without overpowering it.</p>
<h2>Manchego</h2>
<p>Some people might not be familiar with this delightful Spanish sheep&rsquo;s milk cheese, but it&rsquo;s worth getting to know a little better. It has a tangy, nutty flavor that is long on the palate and salty at the finish.</p>
<p>Ideally Manchego should be paired with a Spanish wine as the core flavors are similar. We love the Bodegas Riojanas Vina Albina Reserva as this wine is exceptionally balanced and plays up the salt in the cheese with its strong and complex flavors.</p>
<h2>Fresh Mozzarella</h2>
<p>Distinctly different from the mozzarella found on pizza, the fresh version of this delicate cheese is a real treat that should be enjoyed more often. The true Italian version is made with buffalo&rsquo;s milk and is smooth and sweet with a slightly salty tang.</p>
<p>Fresh mozzarella can be served with either a red or a white wine, but it&rsquo;s best to choose from the wines produced in <a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Cheese-plate-and-wine.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1243"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Cheese-plate-and-wine-224x300.jpg"" alt=""Cheese plate and wine"" width=""224"" height=""300"" /></a>Italy. The Sartori di Verona Rosso is an elegant Italian wine with a sharp acidity beneath its floral notes and is a wonderful complement to the mild mozzarella.</p>
<h2>Brie</h2>
<p>A French cheese characterized by its soft, smooth texture, Brie is a staple in the cheese world and is quite popular. Typically spread on rustic breads or served with fruit, Brie is a sweet and mild cheese that pairs well with a number of wines.</p>
<p>Try Brie with a full-bodied and powerful red wine for the best combination of complex flavors. The E. Guigal Cotes du Rhone is a rich and robust wine, with berry notes and high tannins that meld perfectly with the sweet flavors of the Brie.</p>
<p>Learning to pair wine and cheese can take some practice, but imagine all the fun you&rsquo;ll have while doing it!</p>

"4";"The City Wine Cellar Guide to Food and Wine Pairing";"<p>If you research food and wine pairings you&rsquo;re likely to run into lists of &ldquo;rules.&rdquo; Usually those lists begin with the No. 1 rule: Drink what you like. While this is absolutely true (it is certainly important that you enjoy the wine in your glass), I do believe that there are some fundamental guidelines that can give you a base to understand an intricate subject.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to drink in terms of &ldquo;rules.&rdquo; Wine is meant to be fun and enjoyable, not intimidating. So, let&rsquo;s dispense with the idea that there are any official rules to pairing wine with food. Instead, let&rsquo;s talk in terms of recommendations that will help you get the most out of any dining experience where wine is involved. Who knows, maybe you&rsquo;ll even have an &ldquo;ah ha!&rdquo; moment with that perfect pairing.</p>
<p>For me, the primary focus of any food and wine pairing is <strong>synergy</strong> &mdash; creating something that tastes better than the individual components do on their own (that &ldquo;ah ha!&rdquo; moment I referred to). It is also about <strong>balance</strong>. The food should not overpower the wine, nor should the wine overpower the food.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the following elements of food and wine:</p>
<h2><strong>Complementing Flavors</strong></h2>
<p>The taste of the food and the wine should be similar. A sauce shouldn&rsquo;t be sweeter than the wine, and the acid in the dish should be sufficiently matched to the acid levels in the wine. More on this below.</p>
<h2><strong>Contrasting Flavors</strong></h2>
<p>Opposites attract. Match up contrasting flavors such as sweet wine with a salty dish, or sweet wine with a spicy dish. Or even a light, high-acid wine, with a rich fatty dish.</p>
<h2><strong>Body and Weight</strong></h2>
<p>The weight of a dish should be matched by the weight of the wine.</p>
<p>When it comes to detecting weight in wine, the best analogy is to compare wine to skim milk, whole milk and heavy cream. Skim milk is light on the palate. The more you move toward heavy cream, the heavier it feels on your palate. Light-bodied wines, pinot gris for example, feel more like skim milk, whereas full-bodied wines, like syrah or zinfandel, are closer to that whole-milk feel. Both white and red wines can fit into both categories, light-bodied and full-bodied.</p>
<p><strong>Pair full-bodied dishes with full-bodied wines &mdash; </strong>stewed meat in a rich sauce paired with full-bodied red wine like merlot or syrah. Avoid heavy stewed dishes like this with pinot noir (for example), since most are delicate and lighter in body and will be overpowered by a heavy rich dish like this.</p>
<p><strong>Medium with medium &mdash;</strong> like shrimp scampi with a lightly oaked white wine. Avoid having shrimp scampi with a heavy red wine because both the light flavors of the dish and the lemon will clash with a heavy red wine.</p>
<p><strong>Light with light</strong> <strong>&mdash;</strong> light white fish with unoaked, light-bodied white wine. Just as in the medium example given above, a heavy wine will overpower a light or delicate dish.</p>
<p>Oak usage in wine will generally translate to a heavier feel on your palate. Some wines state on the label whether they have been aged in oak. Others won&rsquo;t. If you are unsure, it&rsquo;s best to ask the wine steward in your wine shop or liquor store if the wine has been aged in oak.</p>
<h2><strong>Sweetness</strong></h2>
<p>The sweetness of a dish should be matched to or exceeded by the sweetness of the wine (otherwise a dry wine tastes sour and unpleasant). This can be especially difficult to do with desserts, which is why pairing wine and chocolate can be tricky &mdash; but not impossible! Sweet wines also pair well with a contrasting flavor, like spicy food. This is because sweet wines can help to cool and refresh the palate after a bite of something with a spicy kick to it. An example of a wine that can be sweet is riesling. Some riesling wines have a useful scale on the back of the label that lets you know the sweetness level of the wine.<a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/white-wine.html""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1314"" alt=""white wine and vegetables"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/white-wine-and-vegetables-224x300.jpg"" height=""300"" width=""224"" /></a></p>
<p>If a wine is described as &ldquo;dry,&rdquo; it usually has zero to very little sweetness.</p>
<h2><strong>Acidity</strong></h2>
<p>Acid is an important factor to consider, and it is found in both food and wine. It&rsquo;s what keeps a wine lively on the palate and gives it an innate ability to pair with food because it acts as a palate cleanser. Good acidity in wine can be detected by a sharpness or jolt in the mouth, usually near the front of your tongue, followed by your mouth starting to water. The more your mouth begins to water, the higher the acidity.</p>
<p>When it comes to pairing, the acidity of the dish should be matched by the acidity in the wine.</p>
<p>If the food is more acidic than the wine, then the wine will taste flabby or flat. Flabby? Think about what happens to soda when the carbonation wears off. The soda becomes flat, uninteresting, and all you taste is the sugar. Would you like to test this out? Try tasting a salad with lemon and vinegar based dressing (two ingredients that are very high in acidity) paired with a viognier or an oaked chardonnay. The wine, which has much less acidity than the dressing, will taste unbalanced and flat paired with the high-acid dish, but with a high-acid wine, like Sauvignon Blanc, it can work quite well.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why Chianti (made from sangiovese grapes, which are high in acidity) and spaghetti or pizza (made with tomato sauce) pair so well. The tomatoes are high in acid, and the sauce is usually medium-heavy bodied. Both go well with a wine that is matched in weight and also high in acid.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, wines from cooler climates tend to display higher levels of acidity. Wines that are generally high in acid include (but are not limited to): sparkling wine, sauvignon blanc, riesling, pinot gris/grigio, sangiovese, and pinot noir.</p>
<h2><strong>Intensity</strong></h2>
<p>If a food is intense in flavor, then the wine should also be intense in flavor. You want a similar level of intensity, not combative. This is why barbecued foods or dishes with rich heavy sauces go better with big, bold intense wines like zinfandel, tempranillo, and syrah.</p>
<p>Intense wines can stand up to fuller-bodied foods. Bold and intense wines, however, will overpower delicate, lightweight, dishes. Similarly, light-bodied or delicate wines don&rsquo;t stand a chance with heavy, rich, bold dishes &mdash; the wine will get lost in the bold flavors of the food.</p>
<p><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1313"" alt=""white wine and creme soup"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/white-wine-and-creme-soup-200x300.jpg"" height=""300"" width=""200"" /></p>
<h2><strong>Fruit, Vegetable, Herbs</strong></h2>
<p>What a dish offers in fruit, vegetables, and herbs can be complemented by similar or contrasting notes in&nbsp;the wine. For example, a light vegetable dish with lots of fresh herbs will pair well with a gr&uuml;ner veltliner, which is a white wine that offers lots of herbal elements. Or, grilled shrimp with fresh lemon squeezed over the top will pair nicely with a wine that offers citrus flavors such as sauvignon blanc.</p>
<h2><strong>Additional Pairing Tips</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Pair complex wines with simple dishes</strong> such as a simple roast paired with aged, quality red wine, like an aged Bordeaux. In this case, the wine is likely something special or unique so you want the wine to stand out but not be overpowered by the food, and you want to be able to focus on the complexities of the wine without interference from the dish.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatively,</strong> <strong>pair simple wines with more complicated dishes</strong>. A spicy Asian dish that has several ingredients could pair with a simple semi-sweet white wine. Here, you&rsquo;re also incorporating contrasting flavors, balancing the spicy and sweet.</p>
<p><strong>Think regional pairing</strong> <strong>&mdash; what grows together <em>goes</em> together.</strong> Goat&rsquo;s cheese with Sancerre (made from sauvignon blanc grapes) is a traditional pairing demonstrating this, and it&rsquo;s one of my favorites. Italian red wines go with pasta. Spanish wines pair with tapas. Pacific salmon with Oregon pinot noir is also a no-brainer and another one of my favorites.</p>
<h2><strong>Components That Interact</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Alcohol accentuates heat.</strong> Try tasting a high-alcohol wine like a zinfandel that has more than 15% ABV paired with a really spicy dish. Everything, both the wine and the dish, will taste hotter (the food will seem spicier and the wine will seem more alcoholic).</p>
<p><strong>Sweetness reduces perception of sweetness.</strong> When you taste a sweet wine paired with an equally sweet dish, you notice the perceived sweetness less. When paired just right, they balance each other out.</p>
<p><strong>Fat and protein reduce perception of tannin.</strong> This is why red meat and young cabernet sauvignon go so well together. The protein and fat from the beef soften the mouth-drying tannins that come from the wine.</p>
<p><strong>Salt also reduces perception of tannin.</strong> Try melting salty blue cheese on a steak and pairing it with a cabernet sauvignon or a tempranillo from Rioja or Ribera del Duero. The salt also reduces the otherwise noticeable tannins of the wine.</p>
<p><strong>Drink What You Like</strong></p>
<p>Like I said earlier, nearly every wine expert will tell you that the No.1 rule of wine drinking is Drink what you like. And while this sentiment is true, I do firmly believe if you want to get the best out of both your food and your wine, there are recommendations you can follow to make the most of your experience. And if you&rsquo;re the type to just drink what you like anyway, then why did you make it to the end of this article?</p>

";"0";"Food,Pairings,Wine";"<p>If you research food and wine pairings you&rsquo;re likely to run into lists of &ldquo;rules.&rdquo; Usually those lists begin with the No. 1 rule: Drink what you like. While this is absolutely true (it is certainly important that you enjoy the wine in your glass), I do believe that there are some fundamental guidelines that can give you a base to understand an intricate subject.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to drink in terms of &ldquo;rules.&rdquo; Wine is meant to be fun and enjoyable, not intimidating. So, let&rsquo;s dispense with the idea that there are any official rules to pairing wine with food. Instead, let&rsquo;s talk in terms of recommendations that will help you get the most out of any dining experience where wine is involved. Who knows, maybe you&rsquo;ll even have an &ldquo;ah ha!&rdquo; moment with that perfect pairing.</p>
<p>For me, the primary focus of any food and wine pairing is <strong>synergy</strong> &mdash; creating something that tastes better than the individual components do on their own (that &ldquo;ah ha!&rdquo; moment I referred to). It is also about <strong>balance</strong>. The food should not overpower the wine, nor should the wine overpower the food.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the following elements of food and wine:</p>"

<p><a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/other-wine/sparkling-wine.html""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1253"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Champagne-bubbles-201x300.jpg"" alt=""Champagne bubbles"" width=""201"" height=""300"" /></a>By now, we should all be aware that we can&rsquo;t call a sparkling wine by the name Champagne unless it has indeed come from the Champagne region of France. We also know that true Champagne can be one of the most expensive wines in the world.</p>
<p>For those with tighter purse strings, there are many fine selections of sparkling wines from around the world that allow you a fizzy wine that won&rsquo;t significantly deplete your savings. While there are occasions when true Champagne is preferable, for all of the other times there are these exceptional choices.</p>
<h2>1 &ndash; Coppola Sofia Blanc de Blanc</h2>
<p>A gem from the famed Coppola vineyard, this sparkling wine packs a fruity punch then soothes with a crisp finish. It&rsquo;s a delicate and bold blend of pinot blanc, sauvignon blanc and muscat grapes.</p>
<p>This bottle is a great accompaniment for a light brunch, a charcuterie or as the perfect beverage for a picnic of fruit and cheese. In short, we love this sparkling wine and the $13.99 price doesn&rsquo;t hurt the wallet.</p>
<h2>2 &ndash; Korbel Brut</h2>
<p>The California Korbel Brut has been the sparkling wine of choice for weddings and other celebrations in the United States, and it&rsquo;s easy for us to see why. We enjoy this crisp, dry brut, and its spicy notes keep the wine from coming off cloying.</p>
<p>Not only does the Korbel Brut have exceptional drinkability, but it pairs well with food. Try it with an herb roasted chicken or a rosemary and salt crusted pork tenderloin. It can also complement Asian dishes like a creamy Thai green curry or a spicy Szechuan noodle dish.</p>
<p>At $25.99 per bottle, drinkers could easily use this sparkling wine for weddings or other festivities.</p>
<h2>3 &ndash; Llopart Rose Cava Brut Reserva</h2>
<p>We can&rsquo;t have a non-Champagne discussion without including Spain&rsquo;s contribution to the sparkling wine world. Cava is one of our favorite sparkling wines, and we love to talk about it.</p>
<p>This Llopart brut is bright and aromatic, and its delicate pink color belies the boldness of its flavors. Fruity top notes mesh seamlessly with the acidity of the tannins, and the tastes come together in a perfect example of Spanish cava.</p>
<p>Try this wine with any type of spicy food, but a good paella would, in our opinion, be the perfect dish to pair with this Spanish beauty.</p>
<p>At $19.99 this bottle is worth a try.</p>
<h2>4 &ndash; Martini and Rossi Asti</h2>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t our mother&rsquo;s Asti! Gone are the days when this wine was called Asti Spumante. Although this Italian <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/other-wine/sparkling-wine.html""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1254"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Sparkling-wine-bubbles-223x300.jpg"" alt=""Sparkling wine bubbles"" width=""223"" height=""300"" /></a>sparkling wine from the Piedmont region is still crafted in the traditional ways, their image has been revamped and they&rsquo;ve shortened and modernized their name.</p>
<p>This wine is considered lightly sparkling; therefore it creates a very different mouth feel. The fruit flavors are crisp and clean, and the body of this wine is extraordinarily light. It&rsquo;s the perfect wine to pair with a light lunch of cheese, fruit and grilled chicken or with fish that&rsquo;s dressed in a light butter sauce.</p>
<p>At $12.99 per bottle, we love the price as much as we love the wine.</p>
<p>These sparkling wines offer all of the flavor and body of their more expensive cousins, but won&rsquo;t cost a fortune. You can try one of these at your next celebration or explore the wide world of sparkling wines for yourself.</p>

"6";"3 Fantastic Cocktails for Your Spring Party";"<h1><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p>Spring is just around the corner and we simply can&rsquo;t wait! Once the winter weather ends, we&rsquo;re definitely ready to throw a party to welcome the season. There are many different themes associated with a spring party, but the ones that we love best are certainly the cocktails!</p>
<p>Springtime cocktails should be fruity and refreshing, and they should definitely use as many fresh ingredients as possible. Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of our favorite cocktails recipes that are sure to make your spring get together the best one yet.</p>
<h2>1 &ndash; Strawberry Basil Margarita</h2>
<p><a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Strawberry-and-basil-margarita.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1249"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Strawberry-and-basil-margarita-300x199.jpg"" alt=""Strawberry and basil margarita"" width=""300"" height=""199"" /></a>Who doesn&rsquo;t love a margarita? The combination of tequila and fresh citrus is refreshing and very pleasing to the palate. There are many variations of this cocktail, but this one that uses fresh strawberries and basil is something special.</p>
<p>This drink is best made by the pitcher. Combine one can of limeade concentrate with two cups each water and tequila. We prefer the Cazadores Reposado for this one, as it has an earthy taste that is perfect for this recipe. Add a dozen sliced strawberries and a handful of crushed basil leaves. Stir the mixture well and place in the refrigerator for at least four hours.</p>
<p>Once the flavors have melded, your margarita mixture will be a delicate pink color. Serve over ice and garnish with a strawberry slice and a small sprig of basil.</p>
<h2>2 &ndash; Gin and Tonic with Cucumber and Rosemary</h2>
<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t love a gin and tonic? This cocktail classic is about as refreshing as they come, and they&rsquo;re perfect for warm spring days. While the gin and tonic is typically garnished with a simple lime wedge to let the flavors of the spirit shine, this version accents the gin with classic cucumber and bold rosemary.</p>
<p>As always, it&rsquo;s best to start with a premium gin. Hendrick&rsquo;s gin is a superb choice as the natural botanical flavors really come through. Another good choice is Caledonia Spirits Barr Hill gin, which adds a touch of local Vermont<a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Rosemary-and-cucumber-gin-and-tonic.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-1248 alignright"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Rosemary-and-cucumber-gin-and-tonic-300x300.jpg"" alt=""Rosemary and cucumber gin and tonic"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a> honey to their recipe.</p>
<p>Begin by peeling half of a large cucumber and slicing the lime into thin wedges. Add one and half ounces of the gin to a glass then add two peeled cucumber slices, the juice of one lime wedge, and a sprig of rosemary. Muddle this well, then strain over ice into a highball glass, then top with tonic. Garnish with a cucumber slice and a sprig of rosemary.</p>
<p>The rosemary in this drink plays well with the botanicals of the gin, creating the perfect balance.</p>
<h2>3 &ndash; St. Germain and Champagne Cocktail</h2>
<p>This delightful twist on a traditional champagne cocktail is simple to make and adds a touch of elegance to a spring function. The elderflower essence of the St. Germain complements a crisp, dry champagne perfectly.</p>
<p>Simply shake one ounce of the St. Germain with ice for a few seconds, strain into a champagne flute, and top with champagne. We love the Perrier Jouet Grand Brut for this cocktail, as its floral and mineral notes blend seamlessly with the St. Germain.</p>
<p>Spring is coming up quickly, so while you wait out the last of winter, start planning your spring get together and add one of these gorgeous and delicious drinks to your menu. Your guests will thank you.</p>

"7";"The Geography of Wine";"<h1><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p><a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Wine-and-decanter-overlooking-vineyard.jpg""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1259"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Wine-and-decanter-overlooking-vineyard-225x300.jpg"" alt=""Wine and decanter overlooking vineyard"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>For those of us at home in the United States, choosing wines from different regions can be a difficult and sometimes daunting choice. The great thing is that here in the U.S. we&rsquo;ve got a huge selection of <a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/red-wine/"">wines from all over the world</a> to choose from. Californian wines, particularly the ones from the Napa Valley, have huge status and the added bonus of buying a domestic product.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to live in a wine-producing region, then you probably have a few local vintners you should try to seek out and taste. If you&rsquo;re trying Californian, then you have a huge variety to choose from &mdash; there are over 100 different varieties of grape grown here. Two of the <a onclick=""javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_wine#Grapes_and_wines"">leading varieties in California</a> are chardonnay and Cabernet sauvignon. Ask your typical Spaniard on the street whether he or she prefers Spanish or French red wine with dinner, and you&rsquo;re likely to get a lesson in European history as well as a clear show of nationalism. For some, the choice of what wine to drink with dinner is a personal, political and even patriotic decision.</p>
<p>Staying in the Americas, Chilean and Argentinian wines are also popular. In fact, Argentina is one of the top five wine-producing regions in the world. When the Spanish colonized South America, they brought grape vines and knowledge of viticulture with them. Later, immigrants from other regions contributed to the development of local wine-making, including vintners from France and Italy. Chile&rsquo;s best-known exports are its cabernet and <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/white-wine/sauvignon-blanc.html"">sauvignon blanc wines</a>, while bottles of malbec are the hot commodity from Argentina. Argentinian wines are often known for their intense flavor.</p>
<p>Across the Pacific in Australia, the wealth of wines available will suit almost any occasion. Australia has over 60 designated wine-making regions and each of those have their own star grapes and tailored appeal. Though it&rsquo;s hard to generalize, from New South Wales, you&rsquo;ll find some of the more traditional, established vintners, though South Australia and Western Australia also have long histories of wine-making. The top grape Down Under is shiraz, though cabernet sauvignon is also popular. Australian wine is becoming more and more popular with consumers because of its overall level of quality between expensive and inexpensive bottles.</p>
<p>Europe has so many different wine regions you could fill a library with books about them. French and Spanish wines are go-to bottles to impress dinner guests, while Italian wines make a fine, earthy companion to any meal. Some of the most popular Italian wines to try are barbaresco, from Piedmont, and, of course, Chianti. For white wine from Europe, you&rsquo;ll find many great varieties from the countries just mentioned, or you might branch out into German or Austrian wines. While grapes for red wine need more sunlight to create a full-bodied flavor, white wines from northern climates are also distinctive and delicious. Reisling and m&uuml;ller-thurgau wines are two of the most important German wine varieties.</p>

The great thing is that here in the U.S. we&rsquo;ve got a huge selection of <a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/red-wine/"">wines from all over the world</a> to choose from. Californian wines, particularly the ones from the Napa Valley, have huge status and the added bonus of buying a domestic product.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to live in a wine-producing region, then you probably have a few local vintners you should try to seek out and taste. If you&rsquo;re trying Californian, then you have a huge variety to choose from &mdash; there are over 100 different varieties of grape grown here. Two of the <a onclick=""javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_wine#Grapes_and_wines"">leading varieties in California</a> are chardonnay and Cabernet sauvignon. Ask your typical Spaniard on the street whether he or she prefers Spanish or French red wine with dinner, and you&rsquo;re likely to get a lesson in European history as well as a clear show of nationalism. For some, the choice of what wine to drink with dinner is a personal, political and even patriotic decision.</p>
<p>Staying in the Americas, Chilean and Argentinian wines are also popular. In fact, Argentina is one of the top five wine-producing regions in the world. When the Spanish colonized South America, they brought grape vines and knowledge of viticulture with them. Later, immigrants from other regions contributed to the development of local wine-making, including vintners from France and Italy. Chile&rsquo;s best-known exports are its cabernet and <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/white-wine/sauvignon-blanc.html"">sauvignon blanc wines</a>, while bottles of malbec are the hot commodity from Argentina. Argentinian wines are often known for their intense flavor.</p>
<p>Across the Pacific in Australia, the wealth of wines available will suit almost any occasion. Australia has over 60 designated wine-making regions and each of those have their own star grapes and tailored appeal. Though it&rsquo;s hard to generalize, from New South Wales, you&rsquo;ll find some of the more traditional, established vintners, though South Australia and Western Australia also have long histories of wine-making. The top grape Down Under is shiraz, though cabernet sauvignon is also popular. Australian wine is becoming more and more popular with consumers because of its overall level of quality between expensive and inexpensive bottles.</p>
<p>Europe has so many different wine regions you could fill a library with books about them. French and Spanish wines are go-to bottles to impress dinner guests, while Italian wines make a fine, earthy companion to any meal. Some of the most popular Italian wines to try are barbaresco, from Piedmont, and, of course, Chianti. For white wine from Europe, you&rsquo;ll find many great varieties from the countries just mentioned, or you might branch out into German or Austrian wines. While grapes for red wine need more sunlight to create a full-bodied flavor, white wines from northern climates are also distinctive and delicious.

"8";"The Perfect Bloody Mary";"<p>If there&rsquo;s one <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/spirits.html"">cocktail</a> that we love, it&rsquo;s the Bloody Mary. This classic drink goes perfectly with a Sunday breakfast or<a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/spirits.html""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-1264 alignright"" style=""float: left;"" alt=""Bloody mary poster"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Bloody-mary-poster-285x300.jpg"" height=""300"" width=""285"" /></a> brunch, and it&rsquo;s an excellent accompaniment while watching a football game.</p>
<p>The origin of this cocktail is murky. Some claim a bartender in Paris first created the drink in 1921, while others attribute its invention to a bartender at New York&rsquo;s 21 Club in the 1930s. Regardless of its inception, the Bloody Mary has consistently been a top seller at bars (and brunches) around the world for years.</p>
<p>As always, recipes for this drink vary widely, but the crux of the combination of ingredients is certainly the tomato juice and vodka. We&rsquo;ll let you in on our secret list of added spices and flavors so that you too can create our favorite Bloody Mary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Vodka</h2>
<p>Of course, the Bloody Mary&rsquo;s success depends greatly on the vodka that is used. Some people choose an inexpensive brand for their Bloody Mary, especially if they&rsquo;ll be serving a large number of guests. A good choice would be Smirnoff or Stolichnaya as both of these vodkas have a smooth, pure taste that lets the other ingredients shine.</p>
<p>Some bartenders absolutely eschew the use of flavored vodka in the Bloody Mary, but we disagree. For those who like their Bloody Mary to pack a punch, consider the Absolut Citron or the Crop Tomato Vodka. Each of these flavored vodkas add complexity to the final product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Spices</h2>
<p>Again, everyone is different, but we have a tried and true list of spices and other ingredients that makes our Bloody Mary sing. We start with eight ounces of fresh tomato juice and add two dashes each of celery salt and black pepper. A healthy dash of Worchestershire sauce is followed by a small dollop of horseradish and a few drops of Tabasco. Add a tablespoon each of olive brine and spicy pickled bean brine, then a squeeze of lemon. Stir the mixture well then combine your desired amount of the mix in a cocktail shaker with ice and vodka. Tumble or stir, then strain over ice.</p>
<p>Of course, each of these ingredients may be adjusted for taste, and some of them, like the pickled bean brine, may not be available to everyone. However, these ingredients are a good basic start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Bloody-mary-garnish.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1263"" style=""float: left;"" alt=""Bloody mary garnish"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Bloody-mary-garnish-300x200.jpg"" height=""200"" width=""300"" /></a>The Garnish</h2>
<p>The standard garnish for a Bloody Mary has typically been a celery stalk and a wedge of lime or lemon. While these garnishes are fine, why not change it up a bit? After all, one of the draws of the Bloody Mary cocktail is the edible goodies that come with it.</p>
<p>Consider something salty like a strip of bacon or a boiled shrimp. Add another salt element with a selection of pickled vegetables on a small skewer. A few olives can also pair nicely with a Bloody Mary, especially if they&rsquo;re stuffed with garlic or bleu cheese.</p>
<p>The garnish is a great way to further personalize your version of the Bloody Mary, and it&rsquo;s certain to have guests singing your praises.</p>
<p>Perfecting the perfect Bloody Mary takes time, but the rewards are definitely worth it. This spicy, tart, immensely satisfying cocktail is definitely a must for your next get together. Try our recipe and enjoy!</p>

"10";"Raise Your Glass: The Best Wines for Celebrating";"<p><a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/other-wine/sparkling-wine.html""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1273"" style=""float: left;"" alt=""Champagne in ice bucked with glasses and rose"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Champagne-in-ice-bucked-with-glasses-and-rose-200x300.jpg"" height=""300"" width=""200"" /></a>Celebrating an anniversary? A new job? Getting ready for summer, Graduation Day or just &ldquo;I feel great&rdquo; day? For many, the act of celebrating is synonymous with the popping cork of a champagne bottle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wine by Itself</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re planning on drinking the wine as a toast, without any canapes, entrees or other flavors to compete with, then the classic choice is sparkling wine. From the pop of the cork to the dizzy effervescence and crisp, light flavor, sparkling wine will help highlight your celebration. For many of us, the idea of &ldquo;bringing out the Champagne&rdquo; is synonymous with celebrating, but you don&rsquo;t have to stick only with the French import &mdash;there are many other region&rsquo;s products to consider as well.</p>
<p>Californian sparkling wine is a hit with many during the holidays, while Italian prosecco and Spanish cava also provide a bit of bubble for your special moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wine With Dinner</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re celebrating over dinner, then popping the cork on a fine bottle of red or white wine will also add pomp to the occasion.</p>
<p>Make a statement by serving your guests a wine from the Chateauneuf de Pape region in France, or, serve a bottle of top-shelf Rioja from Spain. Red wines from this region are balanced and full of flavor.</p>
<p>If you prefer <a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/white-wine.html"">white wine with your meal</a>, pour your fellow celebrants a glass or two of Italy&rsquo;s favorite pinot grigio. A crisp, dry wine, the best-reviewed from this variety come from the Alto Adige region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wine With Cake</h2>
<p>Some announcements are best served with something sweet, so if you&rsquo;re planning on cake with your celebration, such as an office birthday party, you might choose to <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/other-wine/dessert-wine.html"">offer a dessert wine</a> as well.</p>
<p>Ice wine, especially from Canada or Germany, is a smooth, sweet drink that pairs well with cake but is equally delicious on its own. Though the name comes from the harvesting and preparation process &mdash; the grapes are picked when frozen &mdash; and it is best served ice-cold.</p>
<p>If you won&rsquo;t be able to chill your wine before serving, then perhaps Port is another will fit your celebration better. When buying this sweet, fortified wine from Portugal, choose a tawny or late bottled vintage (LBV) for best quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wine for Non-wine Drinkers</h2>
<p>For those who seldom choose wine, simply having it once can be a mark of celebration. If you don&rsquo;t usually drink wine, but you would like to serve it, most experts recommend sticking with wines that are sweet and not dry. For example, rieslings from Germany are often described as light and delicate, and have relatively low alcohol content. Zinfandels are also good for new wine drinkers, though they tend to be more fruity.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d prefer a red wine, or if that&rsquo;s what suits your pairings best, then a pinot noir may be a better bet as it&rsquo;s more light-bodied than most reds and goes well with a large variety of food flavors.</p>
<p>And, whatever you choose, congratulations!</p>";"1";"2014-05-26 00:00:00";"2015-06-12 21:23:33";"raise-your-glass-the-best-wines-for-celebrating";"citywinecellar";"Stacey Bullington";"Sparkling Wine, Champagne, White Wine, Drink Wine, Wine";"What's the best wine to drink for a celebration?

"11";"Irish Whiskey Wars - Irish or Scotch?";"<p><a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Jameson-barrels.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1279"" style=""float: left;"" alt=""Jameson barrels"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Jameson-barrels-300x200.jpg"" height=""200"" width=""300"" /></a>We&rsquo;re aware of the distinct differences between Irish whiskey and Scotch whisky, the least of which is the addition or subtraction of the letter e in the name. Irish whiskey has a much softer taste and lacks some of the characteristic smoke flavor that some Scotch whisky has in abundance.</p>
<p>Still, there are some very apparent differences between Irish whiskies, and those are definitely worth looking into. Let&rsquo;s investigate a little of the history of the top Irish whiskies, Jameson and Bushmills, and see why each whiskey has its own fierce supporters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Jameson</h2>
<p>While we try to never play favorites, it&rsquo;s hard not to prefer this Irish whiskey over any other. It more closely resembles Scotch, and while that&rsquo;s not the ultimate intention, its subtle woodsy and smoky flavors make Jameson a star.</p>
<p>Jameson&rsquo;s was first brewed in 1780 when the Scotsman John Jameson purchased the Bow Street Distillery in Dublin. His whiskey soon became the most popular Irish whiskey brand in the world. By the year 1800, Jameson was producing over a million gallons of whiskey per year.</p>
<p>Jameson whiskey is a mixture of malted and unmalted Irish barley and is therefore considered a blended whiskey. The Jameson brand has persevered through many hardships over the years, including various wars, United States prohibition and fierce competitors, but it is now the bestselling Irish whiskey in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bushmills</h2>
<p>King James I of England granted a distillery license to Sir Thomas Phillips in 1608, but the whiskey wasn&rsquo;t produced under the Bushmills name until 1784. The distillery has changed hands many times over the years and is currently <a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Bushmills-bottle-and-glasses.jpg""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1278"" style=""float: left;"" alt=""Bushmills bottle and glasses"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/Bushmills-bottle-and-glasses-200x300.jpg"" height=""300"" width=""200"" /></a>owned by liquor conglomerate Diageo. Located in County Antrim, the Bushmills brand, while not quite able to reach the sales of Jameson, has consistently produced a range of fine products.</p>
<p>Bushmills has more of a light taste, and the flavors evoke citrus and honey. The product is aged in the same types of barrels as other Irish whiskeys, ports and bourbons, but the final flavors of each whiskey are subtly different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Whiskey Controversy</h2>
<p>Ask any fan of Irish whiskey which brand they prefer and you&rsquo;re likely to get a very spirited response. Drinkers of either Bushmills or Jameson have very specific reasons why they choose one over the other, and while the taste may be one factor, it&rsquo;s sometimes not the main one.</p>
<p>Jameson whiskey is brewed in the southern part of Ireland, officially called the Republic of Ireland, and the area is predominantly Catholic. Bushmills is brewed in Northern Ireland, which is a constituent of the United Kingdom and is predominantly Protestant.</p>
<p>The conflict between the two Irelands is ongoing, but many experts feel that it should have no impact on Irish whiskey, except Irish Americans. In fact, it&rsquo;s those people of Irish descent who live in the United States who started the battle of Irish whiskeys in the first place.</p>
<p>The fact is that both distilleries are now owned by foreign companies, and the conflict between religions is no longer an issue in the creation and distribution of these whiskeys, if it ever was in the first place.</p>
<p>We love our Irish whiskies, and we hope that you will too. Whether you prefer Bushmills or Jameson, try it with a perfectly grilled steak or a fine cigar. You&rsquo;ll be glad that you did.</p>

There are plenty of times in life when a bottle of wine sounds like a great idea, but you don&rsquo;t want to shell out a lot of cash for an expensive tipple.</p>
<p>Luckily, there&rsquo;s plenty of wine, even imported wine, available today that is easy on both the palate and the pocketbook. How can a concerned consumer figure out which wine will taste best for less?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ask An Expert</h2>
<p>One of the best things you can do for your <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/blog/cat/wine-basics/"">wine education</a> is to start asking questions. The next time you visit a wine shop or bump into an off-duty sommelier start asking for recommendations. Don&rsquo;t assume that experts will push you to the most expensive labels for a sale either; most experts in the wine industry truly love their product and will be interested in cultivating you as a long-term customer.</p>
<p>When you ask about the best wine for you, state your maximum price limit and give the person you&rsquo;re asking an idea of when the wine will be imbibed. You&rsquo;ll get a different recommendation if you&rsquo;re <a onclick=""javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://fishcooking.about.com']);"" href=""http://fishcooking.about.com/od/howtochoosefreshfish/tp/wines_and_fish.htm"">pairing the wine with seafood</a>, or with beef, or if you are taking it to a house party where you&rsquo;re not quite sure what will be on the menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>If You&rsquo;re On Your Own</h2>
<p>If there&rsquo;s no one you can ask before you make your choice, you still have some rules of thumb that can guide to you to buying a nice bottle of wine that remains in your price range.</p>
<p>First of all, consider the basics. Do you want red or white wine? In general, if you are going to be drinking the wine while you eat something that has strong flavors, then you want to have a red wine. A steak or a hearty lasagna is complemented by a strong red table wine, such as a <a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/red-wine/shiraz.html"">shiraz</a> or a <a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/red-wine/cabernet-sauvignon.html"">cabernet</a>. Spicy foods can usually stand up next to red wine, as well. Following this rule, if you are planning to eat something with delicate flavors, then you&rsquo;ll want a white wine. That would mean that your linguine with clam sauce or your grilled trout would do nicely with a pinot grigio or chardonnay.</p>
<p>If you are unsure which wine will suit your meal, or if you&rsquo;re planning to enjoy the wine as an after-dinner drink, then you will have to use other criteria. If you like sweet drinks, then there are many fruity white wines available for $20 or less. Rieslings and sauvignon blancs are often citrusy and light.</p>
<p>On the red side, the less expensive Cabernet sauvignons will offer more body and less sweetness than white wine. Some of the Australian Cabernet or Shiraz blends offer great quality at a low price.</p>

<p>Although a few creative concoctions have surfaced over the years, sometimes it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<span>best to stick with the classics. We present to you the top whiskey cocktails that&nbsp;</span><span>every connoisseur, professional or recreational, should know.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Old-Fashioned</h2>
<p>A timeless choice with a simple rye whiskey base, easy to enhance with key&nbsp;<span style=""font-size: 13px;"">ingredients, the Old-Fashioned has weathered many variations, but we think the&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">original version triumphs over all the rest.</span></p>
<p><strong>What you&rsquo;ll need:</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">1 sugar cube</span></p>
<p>2-3 dashes of Angostura bitters</p>
<p>club soda or water (optional)</p>
<p>2 oz rye whiskey</p>
<p>ice cubes</p>
<p>orange</p>
<p><strong>What you do:</strong></p>
<p>Place sugar cube in glass and moisten with a few dashes of Angostura bitters and&nbsp;a skimpy splash (just a drop) of club soda or water. Crush the cube with a wooden&nbsp;<span style=""font-size: 13px;"">muddler (if you don&rsquo;t have one, you can improvise) until the sugar and liquid form&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">a paste. Add whiskey, an ice cube (preferably one large cube), and a piece of orange&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">peel. Stir and serve.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Manhattan</h2>
<p>The Manhattan is undeniably one of the top&nbsp;<span style=""font-size: 13px;"">whiskey cocktails around, as bold and beloved as the city itself.</span></p>
<p><strong>What you&rsquo;ll need:</strong></p>
<p>2 oz rye whiskey</p>
<p>1 oz vermouth</p>
<p>2 dashes of Angostura bitters</p>
<p>maraschino cherries (optional)</p>
<p><strong>What you do:</strong></p>
<p>Stir (don&rsquo;t shake) ice, whiskey, vermouth, and Angostura bitters well. Strain drink&nbsp;<span style=""font-size: 13px;"">into glass and garnish with a maraschino cherry or two.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Ward Eight</h2>
<p>A fan favorite for more than a hundred years, the Ward Eight mixes citrus juices and&nbsp;<span style=""font-size: 13px;"">rye whiskey to create a smooth cocktail with little bite. Hardly a fancy find, the Ward&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Eight&rsquo;s simple sour characteristics is what earned its recognition.</span></p>
<p><strong>What you&rsquo;ll need:</strong></p>
<p>2 oz rye whiskey</p>
<p>3&frasl;4 oz orange juice</p>
<p>3&frasl;4 oz lemon juice</p>
<p>tsp grenadine</p>
<p><strong>What you do:</strong></p>

"14";"Wine Aging";"<p>Street wisdom regarding wine tells us that the older wine is, the better it is. However, this is not always true. Understanding how aging works will contribute to your understanding of when a wine is right to drink or not. As you&rsquo;re building your collection, make sure that you&rsquo;re building your knowledge so that the wines that need to wait will have their time, and the wines that have a shorter shelf life can be enjoyed as well.</p>
<p>Although many believe that aged wine is best, surprisingly only 10% of wines produced actually have the chemical ability to age at all. This means that over 90% of wines are meant to be enjoyed within only a few years. Wine is always perishable, but understanding the properties of a wine&rsquo;s sugars, acids, compounds, an tannins are essential to determining what a wine&rsquo;s ideal aging process should be.</p>
<p>The first step to skillfully aging wine is to make sure you have the proper conditions for storing it. You&rsquo;ll need a wine storage rack inside of a dark, damp, and quiet space. The more out of the way from activity the best, as you want your wine to be free from vibrations. It might be tempting to store red wine in the refrigerator, but avoid this temptation: low humidity will cause corks to shrink and the wine will spoil. Also, you want to make sure your corks stay moist by storing wine tilted sideways or upside down. Again, if the cork dries, the wine could spoil.</p>
<p>The strategy behind aging can be complex, as it varies between wines and requires attention to a variety of chemical details. For example, tannins &ndash; a chemical found in wines &ndash; have enormous influence over the aging, color, body, flavor, and dryness of a wine. As time passes, these tannins break down and form a visible sediment at the bottom of the bottle. This creates a sort of brick, rusty coloring. Also, wines with a low Ph also have greater capability of aging. In white wines, sugar performs similarly to tannins and helps to preserve the wine. The white wines with the capabilities of aging are the ones with the highest level of extract and acidity. Additionally, the quantity of water inside of a grape prior to harvest affects its ability to age: the less water, the more aging.</p>
<p>The best advice to remember is that every wine reaches a point where it is ideal to drink. Too much aging, and the best qualities of the wine are missed; too little aging and the wine might be consumed&nbsp;prematurely. Without the right knowledge of your wines, you might end up holding onto a bottle for far too long.

"15";"Types of flaws in wine";"<p>Nothing in this world is perfect and wine is no different. The process of making wine must be handled carefully. Wine is a very delicate drink and a lot can go wrong even after it leaves the vineyard. From the vineyard to your glass one little slip up could cause it to go bad or to become undrinkable. As such, you should pay special attention to its flavor, texture and color before you start drinking.</p>
<p><strong>Unbalanced.</strong>&nbsp;A balanced wine is a good wine: none of the its elements sticks out or covers the others. Generally speaking, for red wines, it is desirable to achieve balance in the fruit, tannin, and acidity levels. Since whites generally lack tannins, only the fruit and acidity need to be balanced. Most fine wines cannot become balanced if they do not benefit from a certain number of years of bottle age.</p>
<p><strong>Oxygen.</strong>&nbsp;A lot of oxygen is required during the fermentation process of the wine and the ageing process in the barrels. Nevertheless, oxygen is still an enemy to everyone in the wine world. Too much oxygen can cause wine to spoil. If a wine is exposed to too much oxygen, for whatever reason, that wine becomes an oxidized wine. Oxidized wines will sometimes have an unmistakable note of dark earth or mushrooms. Although there are many things you can do to extend a wine&rsquo;s life, once a bottle is opened it is in threat of becoming oxidized.</p>
<p><strong>Cooked</strong>. When a wine is &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; it means that the wine has been exposed to too much heat. Cooked wines are sometimes difficult to identify because there are different levels kinds of damage the wine can suffer. At its worst, a cooked wine can have the aroma of something dull or stewed, but it can also smell sweet like caramel. The smell of a cooked wine is generally a smell of something that has been slow-cooked.Cooked wines will generally also lack in fruit and suffer an imbalance of flavor and alcohol content. It is important to keep the wine at its proper temperature in order to preserve its fineness.</p>
<p><strong>Corking</strong>. Experiencing a &ldquo;corked&rdquo; wine is very common in the wine world and is said to public enemy number one. This condition is also known as cork taint; it is when a microbial fungus, which usually comes from the environment, finds its way into the cork, contaminates it, and then taints the wine. Corked wines have very strong characteristics such as an odor like a moldy newspaper, a damp cloth or a wet dog.</p>
<p><strong>Brettanomyces.</strong>&nbsp;Also known as Brett, brettanomyces is a very controversial flaw because some say &ldquo;little&rdquo; Brett is a good thing in a wine. Brett is the spoilage yeast that is sometimes introduced to produce compounds that alter a wine&rsquo;s flavor. At low levels, winemakers agree that the presence of Brett has a positive effect. At high levels, Brett can produce a funk-like flavor similar to that of sweat or body odor. Even though some people say a little Brett is good, Brettanomyces is very difficult to control once it starts to spread.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 00:33:45";"types-of-flaws-in-wine";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Wine Flaws, Wine Spoilage, Wine Preservation";"Learn all about what can go wrong with wines, how to manage wine damage, and what flaws are worst.";"0";"flaws in wine,Wine,Wine Bottles";"<p>Nothing in this world is perfect and wine is no different.

"16";"Is Wine Good for Your Teeth?";"<p>We can all remember seeing humorous laundry detergent commercials that show us that dangerous glass of red wine slipping out of a woman&rsquo;s hands &ndash; in slow motion, of course &ndash; and all of that delicious red wine splattering gracefully all over her white blouse. For many people, this is a worst-case scenario: how will you ever get out red wine stains? Unfortunately, many people associate this dastardly staining with the way red wine supposedly stains our teeth; some people have even switched to drinking entirely white wine out of fear that they&rsquo;re pearly whites will not be too pearly or too white for very long.</p>
<p>Fortunately, recent research says different than those laundry commercials about our teeth.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how your teeth get damaged: the bacteria that damages your teeth are called streptococcus, and they reside in the mouth feeding off of the sugars in your diet. These bacteria stick to the enamel, and they trigger the process called &ldquo;demineralization&rdquo; which is exactly what it sounds like &ndash; it strips the minerals off your teeth and starts to form holes in the enamel.</p>
<p>So wine has sugars &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t that mean wine will damage your teeth?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. Scientists have found an active ingredient called proanthocyanidins will block streptococcus from sticking to enamel. This ingredient is found in grape skins! Furthermore, later studies have shown that polyphenols, also an ingredient in wine, fight off diseases like periodontitis, which affects the gums and jaw. You can also find these compounds in cranberries, which are well-known infamous for preventing plaque and cavities.</p>
<p>Of course, consuming too many sugars from any source will ultimately have a negative effect on your teeth, but this is only when sugar is an excess part of a diet. As long as you&rsquo;re consuming wine, cranberries, or other sugars in moderation, it is considered normal consumption. And when you regularly brush your teeth and floss, it is likely that your teeth will remain in tip-top condition. That&rsquo;s more than any laundry detergent brand can claim.</p>

"17";"Production of Sweet Wine";"<p>Wine comes in many different forms, shapes and style, from red dries to sweet white, each wine has its own unique flavor and qualities that make them special. Now there are three types of wine: white, red and rose. Each wine is made from a combination of different grapes, and how the wine is made will determine its style.</p>
<p>What is sweet wine? To beginning, there are both sweet red wines and sweet white wines, although generally speaking sweet white wines are much easier to find. Sweet wines are wines that lie on the sweeter side of the spectrum; they are the opposite of a dry wine and have certain flavors and qualities that are very different from other wines. Most sweet wines don&rsquo;t go that well with full meals but they do go very well with desserts. So when a person is asking for a sweet wine what they are saying is they prefer a wine that is not dry.</p>
<p>The production of sweet wine is fairly similar to any other wine, such as it goes through the picking of grapes, the crushing with or without its skin, the fermentation and so on, all the way to the bottling and storage. Now what makes the process different is more about the types of grapes, the varieties, and one major step during the fermentation.</p>
<p>It is the type of grape that really determines what type of wine it is going to be. Since a Sweet wine can be red, white or rose, this first step of the process is generally up to the winemaker in which grapes he wishes to use. The most important feature of the grapes is their age. Wine producers who make sweet wine will choose grapes that had a late harvest. If a grape is left on the vine past the normal harvest time, it will develop a greater concentration of sugar and flavor. Late harvested-grapes will have too much sugar in them, and this residual sugar makes the wine sweeter.&nbsp;Another important fact to know about the grapes that are chosen for Sweet wine production is something called Botrytis, also known as noble rot. This rot is a fungus that saps moisture from the grapes, leaving them with a higher concentration of sugar and acidity.</p>
<p>Sweet wines come in many different styles. Aside from regular <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/white-wine.html"">sweet white</a> and<a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/red-wine.html""> red wines</a>, there are also dessert wines such as Ice Wine, which are very sweet. Ice wines are really unique because they are made from frozen grapes off the vine, the grapes are literally frozen when picked, and they are then pressed and fermented. The result from a frozen grape is a rich, ultra-sweet wine. Another interesting Sweet wine is Moscato, semi-sparkling, semi-sweet to sweet winesmade from Moscato grapes. These wines take aromatics to a whole new level, with fresh floral, ripe stone fruit and exotic spice mark, an extraordinary component to this unique sweet wine. Another Sweet wine is known as Sherry, this is a fortified wine that is produced in Spain within the &ldquo;Sherry Triangle&rdquo; from white wine grapes.

"18";"What Is Tannin?";"<p>Read the back of almost any bottle of red or ros&eacute; wine, or hear any expert describing such a bottle, and you&rsquo;re sure to hear or read the word &lsquo;tannin&rsquo; at some point. Tannins have become a key component for describing the body or character of any bottle of wine, with wines containing a high tannin content being described as &lsquo;full bodied&rsquo;, and those with few tannins being &lsquo;light bodied&rsquo;. Although discussion of tannin levels is common among wine enthusiasts, few of us truly understand exactly what they are and what they do.</p>
<p>Here are a few simple facts which we can consider to help us improve our knowledge of these special compounds and be able to speak about them with a little more confidence when describing a wine.</p>
<p><strong>The Purpose of Tannins</strong></p>
<p>Tannins are found in a wide range of plants, not just grapevines. They occur naturally in leaves, in bark, and noticeably in young fruit on almost all fruit-bearing plants and trees. The tannins present in these lifeforms are responsible for forming complex binding components with the proteins in plants, and in other organic polymers (such as polysaccharides). Most scientists today believe that tannins originally evolved as a sort of defense mechanism for the plant &ndash; tannins have a distinctive and bitter taste, and create a powerful astringent effect in the mouth.</p>
<p>Think of eating an under-ripe grape or plum, and you can see the effect the tannins have on the tongue and roof of the mouth. This effect could put off herbivores and other animals seeking to eat the plant, and as such they are now present in a wide range of vegetation.</p>
<p>When it comes to the grapevines which eventually produce the wines we know and love, the plant itself uses its strongest tannins rather cleverly. Basically, the vine wants the grapes to be eaten. This is how it spreads its seeds &ndash; through the excrement of birds and other animals which eat its juicy fruits. However, when the grapes are young, the seeds within them are not yet ready, and as such, the grapes are extremely astringent and unpleasant to taste. Fascinatingly, it is at the moment when the grapes begin to change color when the tannin levels drop significantly; the grapes become both more visible (red, blue, black, purple etc) to birds and more delicious to eat at the same time, making the plant more likely to spread its seeds and thrive elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Tannins and Wine Production</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to wine production, a winery wants to have a certain amount of control over how much tannin is in its wine. The tannins found in wines do not come from the under-ripe fruit of the vine, though, they come from the seeds, the skins and sometimes the stems of the grape. As such, it is the length of time the grape juice has in contact with the skins, seeds and stems of the fruit that dictates just how much tannin there will be in the wine.</p>
<p>Why would a winery wish to have tannins in their wine? Why would they insist on keeping these bitter and astringent compounds? Wine without tannins, especially <em>red</em> wine without any tannin, is often flat and lacking in character. The &lsquo;body&rsquo; of the wine is what holds the wines complexity and allows the vintner to balance the different aspects of the wine against each other. Just as if the wine&rsquo;s alcohol content was too low, or flavor or acidity too weak, the wine would be imbalanced and uninteresting, the same applies when it comes to the body, or tannin content of the wine.</p>
<p><strong>Tannins and Aging</strong></p>
<p>Tannins are incredibly important when it comes to aging wines. Young wines often have a stronger tannin presence in the bottle, and this sometimes means that the other, subtler and more complex characteristics of the wine are overshadowed by its astringency. By ageing red wines, either in oak barrels, or in the bottle at home or in a cellar, tannins begin to soften and &rsquo;round out&rsquo;, producing more balanced wines capable of expressing more interesting and subtle features. Generally, aged wines are considered far finer than young wines, as there will be a far wider bouquet of aromas and flavors detectable in the bottle, and the wine will be more balanced and interesting on the tongue.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 00:36:51";"what-is-tannin";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Tannins, Wine ";"What is a Tannin, and what does it do to the flavor of wine?

However, when the grapes are young, the seeds within them are not yet ready, and as such, the grapes are extremely astringent and unpleasant to taste. Fascinatingly, it is at the moment when the grapes begin to change color when the tannin levels drop significantly; the grapes become both more visible (red, blue, black, purple etc) to birds and more delicious to eat at the same time, making the plant more likely to spread its seeds and thrive elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Tannins and Wine Production</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to wine production, a winery wants to have a certain amount of control over how much tannin is in its wine. The tannins found in wines do not come from the under-ripe fruit of the vine, though, they come from the seeds, the skins and sometimes the stems of the grape. As such, it is the length of time the grape juice has in contact with the skins, seeds and stems of the fruit that dictates just how much tannin there will be in the wine.</p>
<p>Why would a winery wish to have tannins in their wine? Why would they insist on keeping these bitter and astringent compounds? Wine without tannins, especially <em>red</em> wine without any tannin, is often flat and lacking in character. The &lsquo;body&rsquo; of the wine is what holds the wines complexity and allows the vintner to balance the different aspects of the wine against each other. Just as if the wine&rsquo;s alcohol content was too low, or flavor or acidity too weak, the wine would be imbalanced and uninteresting, the same applies when it comes to the body, or tannin content of the wine.</p>
<p><strong>Tannins and Aging</strong></p>
<p>Tannins are incredibly important when it comes to ageing wines. Young wines often have a stronger tannin presence in the bottle, and this sometimes means that the other, subtler and more complex characteristics of the wine are overshadowed by its astringency. By ageing red wines, either in oak barrels, or in the bottle at home or in a cellar, tannins begin to soften and &rsquo;round out&rsquo;, producing more balanced wines capable of expressing more interesting and subtle features. Generally, aged wines are considered far finer than young wines, as there will be a far wider bouquet of aromas and flavors detectable in the bottle, and the wine will be more balanced and interesting on the tongue.</p>"
"19";"The Myth of the Taste Map";"<p>The science-class diagram is familiar to everyone: a healthy, pink tongue divided into circles and ovals of taste receptors. The very tip of the tongue whispers sweet nothings, and tastes the sweet things in life in return. Receptors for salty tastes flank the sweet on each side. Sour receptors lie close behind. Finally bitterness is tasted at the back of the tongue. This chart, we are told, describe the fundamentals of the human perception of taste.</p>
<p>The idea of the taste map originated in the early 20th century, from psychological research on perception. The original research, published in German and translated into English, demonstrated that all areas of the tongue could perceive all tastes, at various levels of sensitivity. Sugars were sweet, salts were savory, and bitters were acrid, no matter where they fell on the tongue. However, researchers documented some variation in the levels of sensitivity to taste stimuli across different parts of the tongue. These statistical differences in sensitivity across regions of the tongue were minute rather than absolute, but that fact became lost in the translation. The results of the translated study produced a precisely zoned map of tasting ability. This mistaken scientific understanding then became the authoritative scientific model of the tongue for the next several decades.</p>
<p>The taste map is an admittedly attractive theory, for several reasons. The categories are neatly labeled, mutually exclusive, and seem logical. They complement and contrast: sugar and salt, sweet and sour, and so on. Therein lies the beauty of wine, grapes, cheese, and crackers &ndash; their taste profiles complement each other harmoniously.</p>
<p>Creating an effective wine pairing often starts with a consideration of the taste profiles of the food and the intended drink. By using the taste map concepts to choose well-paired products, wine enthusiasts from hobbyists to sommeliers can achieve outstanding effect. The descriptive capacity of winemakers and professional tasters and judges has created a wealth of gustatory information from which wine enthusiasts can evaluate their beverages.</p>
<p>The existence of the taste map is treated as a part of the oenological canon, even though there is no evidence to support it. The misunderstanding in the translation has created a popular knowledge misconception of taste that has persisted ever since. The very strictest interpretation of taste mapping theory &ndash; that tasting abilities are confined to specific zones of the tongue &ndash; has long been disproven. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the theory is left without any sort of legacy. Taste mapping theory achieved long-lasting (and arguably, ongoing) popularity because it offers a straightforward, qualitative measure of taste. The ability to qualify and describe wines in a standardized fashion has enabled greater popular engagement with wine culture.</p>
<p>The popularization of wine culture and improvements in perception research methodology has renewed interest in taste mapping theory. Newer research has confirmed the conclusion of the original study, that taste receptors of all kinds are present throughout the tongue. What creates the illusion of the taste map is the density of each type of receptor on the tongue. It&rsquo;s possible &ndash; but not yet proven &ndash; that there are more sweet receptors at the front of the tongue, salty on the sides, sour and bitter in the back. How would this impact the nuance of complex tastes?</p>
<p>The objective scientific answer is, &ldquo;not much.&rdquo; As early as 1875, research on taste supported the idea that taste receptors of all kinds were located throughout the entire tongue. The evidence indicated that there was very little difference in sensitivity across different areas, which suggests that the receptor density and distribution may be fairly uniform. This suggests that the experience of taste may be highly consistent across the tongue, and that this consistency itself might be a feature of taste perception.</p>
<p>What does this finding mean to wine drinkers who attend to the entire experience of wine: taste, aroma, aeration, flavor, and mouth feel? What does it say about the engineering efforts that have gone into optimizing glasses, decanters, and other tools of the trade?</p>

"20";"The Differences between Appellation and Varietals";"<p>Learning all of the differences between how countries label their wines can seem like a trying ordeal. Reading labels from around the world can seem intimidating, but really there are a few simple distinctions you can learn to make that will incredibly increase your ability to comfortable read these labels. One of these differences is between varietal and appellation. When you are familiar with what these terms mean and which countries use them, you will no doubt be better prepared to know what you are drinking from any country.</p>
<p>The term <strong>varietal</strong> is used when talking about the actual grapes used in a wine. This is perhaps a little bit easier to decipher, because when a bottle says &ldquo;Merlot&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll know that those were the grapes that were produced and that&rsquo;s the kind of wine that you&rsquo;re drinking. This type of labeling is used in most countries, including North America, Australia, Chile, and South Africa. Many people feel comfortable with this type of labeling since if you know the characteristics of the grape used in production then you will likely be able to know what the wine will taste like. There is one technicality with this type of labeling, though: the labels only show the varietal that is used the most in the wine. For example, a Merlot may contain 10% zinfandel, but because the majority of the grapes used in the wine are Merlot, then the wine would be labeled a Merlot.</p>
<p>The other labeling style, called <strong>appellation</strong>, is a system of labeling based on a wine&rsquo;s location of production. It tells you where the wine&rsquo;s grapes come from. This style is used most often for the old world wine countries like France, Spain, and Italy, each which labels their wines from the regions. So if you&rsquo;re reading a French red wine bottle that says &ldquo;Bordeaux France,&rdquo; it means they will have certain characteristics of a Bordeaux styled wine. So if red Bordeaux are full-bodied and dry, then you&rsquo;ll know by reading this label that your red Bordeaux will likely have these characteristics.</p>
<p>Many might say that one labeling style is better than the other, while others say that both are fine. It is hard to tell which system of labeling is actually better, but more countries have been using varietal labeling.</p>
<p>Now, no matter which label you see, you&rsquo;ll be able to read and understand what it&rsquo;s telling you just a little better. With time and experience, you&rsquo;ll know what kind of wine is waiting underneath that label.

"21";"The Sugar Content in Wine";"<p>In today&rsquo;s health-conscious culture, we find ourselves asking questions we hadn&rsquo;t considered years ago. One popular question has been, &ldquo;How much sugar is in wine?&rdquo; While we enjoy the sweet flavors many wines provide, we also feel obligated to make sure we are not overindulging in one of America&rsquo;s favorite vices. Just like everything else about wine, there is a large variety of how wines achieve their sweetness, and once you learn the science behind the sweetness you will be better equipped to identify the wines that are best for your health concerns.</p>
<p>A wine&rsquo;s sweetness depends on a variety of factors, including alcohol levels, acidity levels, and concentration of tannins, among other factors. The natural sugars in grapes develop through a process of translocation of sucrose molecules produced through photosynthesis. These molecules are converted into glucose and fructose &ndash; our friendly sugars. These sugars are then converted into alcohol by fermentation. And the delicious sweetness we taste is largely determined by how long the fermentation process lasts.</p>
<p><strong>Residual sugar</strong></p>
<p>Fermentation does not consume all of a wine&rsquo;s sugar. The sugar that remains after fermentation is known as residual sugar, and this is measured in grams per litre of wine, which is usually represented by g/l or g/L. The lowest amount of sugar you will find is about 1g/L. It is rare to find any level lower because some sugars, like pentose, just do not ferment.</p>
<p>The quantity of sugar ranges quite a bit, however. The highest amount of sugars can range anywhere well above 50g/l. Wines like Tokaji and some ice wines are over 100 g/l. This might sound over powering, but such wines are balanced with acidity to make them very delicious. While some wines are infused with acidity to balance their taste, others have residual sugar added to them to purposely make them sweeter. This process is called Sussreserve, and it is primarily practiced in regions in and around Germany.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of sweetness</strong></p>
<p>Much of understand wines comes with understand the terminology for its different aspects. There are different words or names that are associated with sweet and dry wines as well as the levels of sweetness in sparkling wines. Below you will find some of the most common terms associated with a wine&rsquo;s level of sweetness of dryness.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/other-wine.html"">Champagne and Sparkling wines</a>:</strong></p>
<p>1. Brut Natural- contains around 0-3 g/l of sugar. This is as dry as a wine can be. 2. Extra Brut- contains 0-6g/l, and offers a very dry taste. 3. Brut- contains 0-12 g/l, while not as dry as &ldquo;Brut Natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;Extra Brut&rdquo; is still on the dry side and contains far less sugars than other wines.<br />4. Extra Dry, Extra Sec, Extra Seco- contains12-17 g/l. A middle-of-the-road wine in terms of how sweet and dry it is.<br />5. Dry, Sec, Seco- contains 17-32 g/l. The dryness decreases and the sweetness increases once you reach this level.<br />6. Demi-Sec, Semi Seco- contains 32-50 g/l. These make for delicious complements to fruits and desserts.<br />7. Doux, Sweet, Dulce- contains 50+g/l. The sweetest level of wine available.</p>
<p>As you drink certain wines expecting them to be rather sweet, you must remember that other contents in the wine &ndash; like its alcohol and acidity levels &ndash; will balance out the sweetness. This can cause supposedly sweet wines to not taste as sweet as you might expect:<br />1. Dry- Dry wines fall somewhere around or up to 4 g/l depending on acidity and alcohol.<br />2. Medium Dry- These wines have up to 12 g/l<br />3. Medium- These wines have up to 45 g/l<br />4. Sweet- These wines have more than 45 g/l</p>
<p>The levels indicated on the labels are estimated, and will certainly vary depending on that specific wine&rsquo;s level of acidity and alcohol. People frequently mistake sweet wines with cheap wines, but this is not the case. In fact, sweet wines can be rather expensive. Sometimes, sweet wines have a high level of acidity that makes them taste dry or, conversely, dry wines might have a high level of alcohol that makes them taste sweet.</p>

"22";"What is a Full-Bodied Wine?";"<p>Sometimes we talk about wine like we talk about women. &ldquo;I love the body!&rdquo; But what do we mean when we say this? What does it mean when we speak about a wine being &ldquo;full-bodied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wine is not just a drink, but an engrossing experience for the senses. The body of a wine refers to the full inundation of our senses when the wine is in our mouth: the wine&rsquo;s texture, weight, and feel all compose our impression of the wine&rsquo;s &ldquo;body.&rdquo; No single component of the wine determines what its body is like, just like we can&rsquo;t look at a person&rsquo;s arm and discern the rest of their shape. The features of a wine&rsquo;s acidity, glycerol, extract, alcohol, and so on all contribute to that rich, well-rounded flavor we have lingering in our mouths.</p>
<p>Some of the red wines known for being described as &ldquo;full-bodied&rdquo; include Cabernet Sauvignon and French Bordeaux. Full-bodied white wines include Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. The uniting feature of each of these is that they are dry &ndash; dry wines frequently possess that pucker type of feeling that loiters in our mouths like a guy loiters near a girl&rsquo;s house after his first great kiss. These wines are also typically aged in wood.</p>
<p>Sugar also has the ability to give a wine a full-bodied feeling. Dessert wines, for example the Sauternes, have the extra sugar needed to give them that robust flavor.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, the idea of a wine being full-bodied is really in the mouth of the taster. Everyone possesses their own unique perception of a wine&rsquo;s characteristics, and so what might feel full-bodied to one individual might not taste as full to another. A good comparison for understanding the term &ldquo;full-bodied&rdquo; can be made with milk. Different milks come with different textures, from cream to half and half, from regular milk down to 2%. As you experience different bodies of milk, you can think of wine similarly.</p>
<p>Of course, to fully enjoy any wine&rsquo;s body, you want to consider certain food pairing recommendations. When enjoying what to you is a full-bodied wine, the ideal partner might be a hearty meat or a heavy pasta. If the meal is &ldquo;full-bodied&rdquo; and hearty, then the wine should be too, and vice versa. Light foods likewise deserve light wines. I distinctly recall enjoying a Vinho Verde with a salad, and the combination made the green bell pepper so vivacious and intense. But the best way for you to enjoy wine, learn about body, and find the ideal food pairings is to explore for yourself.

"23";"Whiskey Around The World";"<p>Whiskey has proven to be one of the world&rsquo;s most enduring and popular alcoholic spirits, with a vast range of countries attempting to produce whiskies in their own style today. While we commonly associate whisky with the golden age of Scotland in the 19th century, the Scots were far from the first to make this special and recognizable drink. Indeed, there is much evidence to suggest that the techniques still common to this day were being employed by ancient cultures across the world, and one often stumbles across debates over who was the first to make and enjoy this drink. One of the most popular theories points towards the ancient Babylonians of Mesopotamia, who could well have been fermenting grains for the production of whiskey as long as four thousand years ago, where it was enjoyed as an aromatic drink, flavored and perfumed with various spices, and used as a medicinal treatment for a wide range of ailments.</p>
<p>Whiskey was brought to the British Isles, where it was made in the 15th century by Irish and Scottish monks for both medicinal and recreational purposes. When Henry VIII dissolved England&rsquo;s monasteries, whiskey production was forced into private hands. The whiskey produced in England in the 15th and 16th centuries was very different from the drink we widely enjoy today, as the distillate was not left to age and mellow in wooden casks, resulting in a harsh, highly alcoholic, and somewhat brutal drink. Indeed, it is likely that several people died from drinking this early whiskey, as it was difficult to control its alcohol content.</p>
<p><strong>Scottish and Irish Whiskeys</strong></p>
<p>Over time, whiskey became an important product for the economies of both Scotland and Ireland. Both countries initially made whiskey in similar styles. Today Irish whiskey distinguishes itself from Scotch whisky (which is sometimes spelled without the &ldquo;e&rdquo;) by being distilled three times. By law, Irish whiskeys must be aged for a minimum of three years in wood, where it takes on its distinctive earthy and oak tones. Irish whiskey is also usually made from unpeated malt, while Scotch whisky prides itself on the peat smoking process, in which the grains or malt used in the production are infused with smoke from burning the black peat which is found all over the country. This process which helps give Scotch its unique flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Whiskies of the USA</strong></p>
<p>One of the other key countries to involve itself in whisky production over the past couple of centuries has been the United States of America, where immigrants from the British Isles were quick to set up whisky distilleries of their own in the New World. American whiskies differ quite considerably from their Scottish and Irish cousins, as they commonly use both corn and rye in their cereal content &ndash; ingredients which were growing extensively in the United States and required little cultivation.</p>
<p>American whiskies are split into several categories, being Bourbon, Malt, Rye, Corn, Rye Malt and Wheat whisky, each of which must contain no more than eighty percent alcohol, and must, by law, be aged in wooden casks (with the exception of corn whisky). One very American whiskey is Tennessee whiskey, a style which normally stands out from other American whiskies and which is enjoyed all over the world. In Tennessee, it is common for their whiskies to be filtered through charcoal made from sweet maple, which lends the drink a distinctive and very American flavour.</p>
<p><strong>Canadian Whisky</strong></p>
<p>Further north, we find the interesting and highly drinkable Canadian whiskies, which are often far lighter and smoother than their USA counterparts. In Canada, whiskies are often sweetened using caramel, and have various flavorings added to the blend. Although Canadian whiskies are unlikely to satisfy purists in the Old World, they are widely popular in Canada and various other countries because they are so accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Other Countries</strong></p>
<p>The past few decades have seen an explosion of whisky production all across the globe, and notable countries include those in Scandinavia, where distilling all sorts of grains and herbs has been commonplace for centuries. Scandinavian whiskies &ndash; particularly those made in Sweden and Finland &ndash; have received critical acclaim, and it is expected that several more distilleries will open in the next few years. Germany is also establishing a whisky culture, as are countries as far away from whisky&rsquo;s spiritual home as Japan and India, where drinking and collecting fine whisky is seen as a status symbol.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:08:59";"whiskey-around-the-world";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Irish Whiskey, Scotch Whiskey, Canadian Whiskey, American Whiskey";"What are the differences between all the world's whiskeys - Irish, Scotch, Canadian, American - how can you tell them apart?

While we commonly associate whisky with the golden age of Scotland in the 19th century, the Scots were far from the first to make this special and recognizable drink. Indeed, there is much evidence to suggest that the techniques still common to this day were being employed by ancient cultures across the world, and one often stumbles across debates over who was the first to make and enjoy this drink. One of the most popular theories points towards the ancient Babylonians of Mesopotamia, who could well have been fermenting grains for the production of whiskey as long as four thousand years ago, where it was enjoyed as an aromatic drink, flavored and perfumed with various spices, and used as a medicinal treatment for a wide range of ailments.</p>

"24";"Sparkling Wines: The Difference between Brut and Extra Dry";"<p><a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/other-wine.html"">Champagne and sparkling wine</a> labels possess many potentially confusing components that can easily frustrate an earnest buyer. What does it mean when you see &ldquo;brut&rdquo; or &ldquo;demi-sec&rdquo; on a label? Or when a bottle is identified with &ldquo;NV&rdquo; on it? Each of these labels refers to the champagne or sparkling wine&rsquo;s level of dryness. &ldquo;NV&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;non-vintage,&rdquo; and means that the product is a blend of several different years. In fact, the majority of champagne and sparkling wine market is dominated by non-vintage types.</p>
<p><strong>Classifications of Dryness</strong></p>
<p>Since champagnes and sparkling wines are identified according to their dryness, it is important to understand how to interpret these labels. It is, in fact, not very difficult once you grasp the terminology:</p>
<p><strong>Extra Brut &ndash;</strong> This is the driest classification. Many people falsely believe that &ldquo;extra dry&rdquo; is the driest, but this is not the case. If you like dry, then Extra Brut might be the best for you.</p>
<p><strong>Brut &ndash;</strong> While not as dry as &ldquo;extra Brut,&rdquo; Brut still represents a fairly dry drink.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Dry &ndash;</strong> This classification, confusingly, is actually the middle-of-the-road dryness. Extra Dry champagnes and sparkling wines make great aperitifs or can mix well with juice for delicious mimosas.</p>
<p><strong>Demi-Sec &ndash;</strong> This is the sweetest and least-dry designation. These champagnes and sparkling wines pair well with desserts and fruits.</p>
<p><strong>The Bubbles</strong></p>
<p>Children love playing with bubbles. Adults enjoy drinking them. The bubbles you&rsquo;ll find inside of your favorite champagnes or sparkling wines come from the second fermentation process. Other ways bubbles arrive are through either the company injecting carbon dioxide into the mixture, or by adding sugar and a few grams of yeast which will carbonate the drink. You&rsquo;ll find that the standard amount of pressure in a bottle of champagne or sparkling wine stands at 80 PSI.</p>
<p>The intoxicating aromas of champagnes and sparkling wines feel reminiscent of pears, apples, or &ndash; thanks to the yeast &ndash; from fresh bread. The flavors also frequently provide fruit-inspired tingles, ranging from apple to strawberry, and even suggest hints of cream and vanilla.

A pot still works simply by heating a liquid and capturing the rising vapors through the oddly-shaped necks on the top.</p>

"26";"Which Wine is More Dry: Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot?";"<p>How many times have you entered a wine store and seen individuals staring blankly at the enormous wall of <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/red-wine.html"">red wine</a>? How many times have you been that person who is overwhelmed with the vast selection of red wines? Today, there are so many different varietals and styles of wine to select from that unless you walk into a store having some information about wine, you will very easily be overwhelmed. Here are a few tips to help you understand the different types of red wines just a little bit more.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the term &ldquo;dry.&rdquo; Have you ever that it&rsquo;s funny that a beverage could be described as &ldquo;dry&rdquo;? Every wine has tannins in it. Tannins are are polyphenolic compounds that bind to proteins. Plants naturally produce tannins as a form of self-defense, swathing themselves in a bitter, astringent taste. By the time tannins get to us, they are giving the wines we drink a unique, irreplaceable flavor. That astringent, puckering sort of experience you get when drinking &ldquo;dry&rdquo; red wines is thanks to the presence of tannins. These tannins are bind to the proteins in your saliva to produce the full-bodied and dry tastes in wine. The more tannins a wine possesses, the drier it&rsquo;s going to taste.</p>
<p>When it comes to comparing Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon has more tannins in it and would naturally be the drier of the two. However, the final product still depends on the type of production and goals of the individual winemaker. One factor that affects a wine&rsquo;s dryness is the time it is harvested. Sweet wines often come from grapes that are harvested late in the season, when their sugars have more time to condense. If the grapes are harvested early, the grapes will have fewer sugars and more acids, making them drier. So there are many factors involved when determining how dry a wine will be.</p>
<p>If you are just starting out experimenting with red wines, I would go with a nice Merlot. It is an all-around wine that isn&rsquo;t too dry and isn&rsquo;t too sweet. Merlot can pair with many foods, and is also a great drink all by itself. While the flavor profile is similar to Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot tends to be less distinctive and slightly more herbaceous overall in taste and aroma.</p>

"28";"Why Are Wine Bottles Shaped Like That?";"<p>Walking through a wine shop can often feel like we&rsquo;re walking through a house of mirrors at a carnival &ndash; there are so many different shapes and colors that we can begin to feel overwhelmed, disoriented, and equally entertained. Although most bottles hold about 750ml of wine and are made from glass, there are an astounding number of differences between the ways bottles are made and the functions they perform.</p>
<p><strong>Wine Bottle Shapes</strong></p>
<p>The main reason why bottles feature the shapes and colors they do is because of tradition. Wine producers from traditional countries and regions have an extensive history of working with certain bottle shapes. By maintaining loyalty to the shape of the bottle, these producers are carrying on the tradition of their forefathers. In fact, you can frequently tell where a wine has come from just by looking at the bottle&rsquo;s shape and color.</p>
<p>You might also notice that the bottoms of many wine bottles have what appears to be a sort of indent, or dimple. This is known as a punt &ndash; also known as a kick up &ndash; and doesn&rsquo;t entirely seem to have a good reason for being there except as a tradition. It is rumored that glass blowers indented the bottle of wine bottles so that they could not leave a mark that would scratch the table. Others believe that this dimple made bottles less likely to tip over. And still others theorize that tavern servants stuck their thumb in the dimple to indicate to barkeeps if a patron was reliable or not.</p>
<p>If you were to look closely at champagne bottles, you&rsquo;ll also see that they are thicker than wine bottles. This is due to the carbonation present. When it comes to wire meshes on sparkling wine corks, we can thank Dom Perignon, who was one of the first to invent this modification to prevent corks from popping off and hitting unsuspecting bystanders.</p>
<p>Typically, wine producers try to match a wine&rsquo;s bottle shape to its style. For example, if a wine has characteristics similar to Bordeaux, then it would be placed in bottle similar to the Bordeaux bottle. Fortified wines, such as port or sherry, have studier bottles with a bulge in the neck, supposedly for catching fortification sediment. The types of bottles will vary as much as the wines themselves do.

These dessert wines can be red, rose or white, but sparkling wine is generally white. A good example of sparkling wine is champagne. All wine styles are made differently, the way sparkling wine is produced starts just as any other wine, with the grapes.</p>
<p>Grapes that are normally picked for sparkling wine are usually a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. The grapes are picked, stemmed (sometime) then crushed. The pressing of the grapes into juice is done quickly so that they can be kept white. From this point the production of sparkling wine is fairly similar to all other wines, they are placed in a vessel that will allow the grape juice to undergo fermentation. During this first stage of fermentation, the process is pretty much the same as any other wine. Some yeast may be added into the must (another name for the grape juice) that will cause the sugars in the grapes to be converted and changed into alcohol and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>After the first fermentation, the wine is still a regular wine. The next step in the production of sparkling wine is the second fermentation. The blended wine is placed in bottles along with yeast and small amounts of sugar. These bottles are corked with temporary plugs and stored in the wine cellar. During the second fermentation, the carbon dioxide is trapped in the wine, and the amount of sugar added will determine the pressure in the bottle. The whole purpose of second fermentation is really to get more carbon dioxide trapped in the wine.</p>
<p>After the second fermentation, the lees from the wine must be removed. For this to happen, the bottles undergo a process known as riddling. Riddling is when the wines are placed on special racks known as pupitres, which hold the bottles at a 45 degree angle. Once a day the bottles are given a slight shake and turn, alternatively on right then left, and dropped back into the pupitres, with the angle gradually increased. The purpose of this is that because of the angle of the bottles the rack causes a slight tap, pushing sediments towards the neck of the bottle. After a number of days the bottle is straightened up, and the lees settle in the neck. Manual riddling is still done, but it has largely been abandoned because of the high labor cost. Most sparkling wines are now done with mechanized riddling equipment.</p>
<p>Once all the lees are on the neck of the bottle the next stage would be to remove them. This is called disgorging. Traditionally, this has been a very time-consuming manual process, in which an employee would be required to remove the lees using a crown cap while losing as little liquid as possible and adding sugar. Now, the disgorging process is done automatically by freezing a small amount of the liquid in the neck then removing that frozen plug.</p>
<p>Immediately after the disgorging, the wine has a little sugar added to it, this practice of adding sugar after disgorging is known as dosage. The sugar is a mixture of the base wine and sucrose, with the addition of sulfur dioxide as a preservative. The amount of sugar determines the sweetness of the sparkling wine, the sugar previously in the wine having been consumed in the second fermentation. The sugar is not added to sweeten the wine, but to balance its high acidity. Finally, the wines are then sealed and then placed in cellars for aging.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:14:33";"sparking-wine-production";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Sparkling Wine, Wine Production, Wine, Champange";"How are champagne and sparklings wine made, and how is it different from flat wine?

"30";"Picking a Wine in a Restaurant";"<p>Trying to select the right wine from a restaurant&rsquo;s wine list can be as difficult as trying to guess a stranger&rsquo;s name. You are more likely to guess wrong than right. Wines often have a strange language attached to them that can be difficult, or even impossible, to decipher. Even when restaurants do add descriptions, they only provide a brief sentence or two, and these sentences are usually inaccurate. Plus, if you think about it, it&rsquo;s unlikely that you&rsquo;ll get a good idea of what something tastes like just by reading about it anyway. Additionally, restaurants rarely employ a sommelier or waitperson who has enough wine knowledge to steer you in the right direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult enough to choose food from a menu, let alone wine, so here are a few friendly tips to help you make confident wine decisions at restaurants.</p>
<p>1. When in doubt, go with what&rsquo;s familiar. Randomly selecting a wine that &ldquo;sounds good&rdquo; will rarely provide you with a familiar experience. In fact, it&rsquo;s quite likely that a random wine selection will turn an otherwise enjoyable dining experience into a horrible dining experience. Consider your company, too &ndash; don&rsquo;t you want to make a good impression and help them enjoy their meal? The surest way to achieve this is to select a wine you already know you like. Don&rsquo;t choose wines blindly.</p>
<p>2. Never select a wine based on price. Remember that just because a wine is expensive does not mean that it is good. Restaurant&rsquo;s wine prices can be as outrageous as Richard Simmon&rsquo;s outfits. Some wines are marked up to double their retail value. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much money you throw at a wine bottle, if it tastes cheap then it tastes cheap. And there&rsquo;s nothing more disappointing than spending a lot of money on something you do not enjoy or appreciate.</p>
<p>3. Ask questions. Good restaurants will list a wine&rsquo;s vintage, varietal, and price. Don&rsquo;t be distracted by other, less important, information. When restaurants try to hide this, they may be trying to scam you by marking up an undesirable wine.</p>
<p>4. Beware of &ldquo;mark up.&rdquo; If you know what you would pay for the same or similar wine at the store, then don&rsquo;t be suckered into paying two times or more of the wine&rsquo;s retail cost. If the wine costs more than twice what you&rsquo;d pay at the store, then you are paying far too much.</p>
<p>5. Try calling the restaurant ahead of time and ask if you can bring your own bottle of wine there. You&rsquo;d be surprised at how many restaurants allow you to do this; some restaurants may simply charge a small &ldquo;corking fee&rdquo; for this privilege. When you call ahead, you have the additional benefit of speaking to the restaurant about its wine selection and making your plan ahead of time. If you do bring a bottle of your own, try to make sure it&rsquo;s not a bottle from their menu &ndash; it would be considered rude to do so and you can expect a hassle.</p>
<p>6. While you might be thinking about the markup on a wine bottle, also beware of the markup on individual glasses of wine as well. Uninformed consumers can get suckered into paying far more for a glass of wine than they might pay for an entire bottle. Remember that you can get on average about four glasses of wine out of the typical bottle, so if one glass is costing you more than what the entire bottle is worth, then your smarter option is just to buy the bottle.</p>
<p>7. Finally, you should know that not all restaurants are trying to use wine as another way to dig deeper in to your pocket. Some restaurants are honest and have a genuine approach to their promotion and pricing of wine. At the same time, don&rsquo;t be so eager to believe everything you see and hear &ndash; use your wine knowledge and your experience to guide you to make wise wine purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>There are just a few simply tips that can help guide you through the daunting task of ordering wine at a restaurant. The more educated, experienced, and confident you are the more like you will be to make a successful wine selection while dining out. So go with what you know about wine, and your selection should turn out fine. As always, enjoy!</p>

"31";"Portuguese White Wine";"<p>Not many people think of Portugal at all when they are thinking about wine, but <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/wine-by-region"">Portugal</a> produces many varieties of wine that can offer surprising and refreshing choices. Portugal produces very popular port wines and Madeira, but they also provide the world with some delicious red and white wines that are equally tempting.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Portuguese wines are produced in the northwest part of Portugal. These wines typically contain lower alcohol content with lots of acidity, and when compared to other wines they are described as refreshing, clean, and crisp, with hints of fruit and a touch of sweetness. Red and whites are fantastic options, but the country might actually be most largely known for what they call their &ldquo;Green Wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You might be most familiar with the Portuguese export called Vinho Verdes, which translates to &ldquo;Green Wine&rdquo; and describes the characteristics of the wine more than the color. Vinho Verdes is actually a white wine and is named after the region where it is produced. The region is in the northern part of the country, very close to the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>Some of the grapes that make fantastic Portuguese white wines are the Alvarinho and Loureiro grapes. Other white wines that may stimulate your palate are Lagoalva Espirito Branco (which is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc), Alvarinho, Verdelho, Arinto and Fernao Pires. The Lagoalva wine region is located south of the Tagus River. Most of these white wines from Portugal are an excellent choice to pair with appetizers before a meal.

"32";"How to Read a French Wine Label";"<p>Wine drinkers know that some of the best wine in the world comes from <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/wine-by-region"">France</a>. But sometimes these labels can be a little mysterious to decipher. After all, they&rsquo;re in French. But what&rsquo;s more is that not only is the language difficult to read, the information the French wine labels display might not be the type of information you&rsquo;re accustomed to finding on a label. Fortunately, there are just a few simple terms you need to learn that will turn your reading of a French wine label from a frustrating to an enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>First, you must understand that the French don&rsquo;t label their wines according to type. For example, you won&rsquo;t see &ldquo;Cabernet Sauvignon&rdquo; or &ldquo;Merlot&rdquo; on a label. This might be what you&rsquo;re used to, since many of us go to the wine store and think &ldquo;I want a Merlot&rdquo; or &ldquo;I think a Pinot Grigio will be good tonight.&rdquo; Instead, the French prefer to label their wines based on location, and many bottles can give you very precise information about where the wine comes from. This might seem odd to you, but you need to learn that to the French, the region is the variety. They don&rsquo;t think about wines based on what they are &ndash; they think about wines based on where they are.</p>
<p>All of the different regional classifications of France are broadly divided into four different labels. When you&rsquo;re examining a French wine label, look for one of these four designations first:</p>
<p>1. First, there is the <strong>Vin de Table</strong> which is produced from a variety of different grapes and regions. This wine is usually less expensive and is not measured to specific quality standards.<br />2. Second, there is <strong>Vin de Pays</strong> which tells you that a wine is coming from one specific area. Usually you can find excellent wines for reasonable prices in this category.<br />3. Third, there is <strong>Vin Delimite de Qualite Superieure</strong> which is a classification that is a little outdated and you&rsquo;re unlikely to see.<br />4. And fourth, perhaps the most exciting category, is called <strong>Vin d&rsquo;Appellation d&rsquo;Origine Controlee</strong>&nbsp;(AOC) which indicates that the wine is strictly controlled. This label will give you the most information, often including the specific grapes, specific region, and specific standards that are enforced to guarantee quality. It will likely even tell you the proprietor of the vineyard and it will name the estate where the grapes were grown.</p>
<p>Because France has very strict rules about how they produce and label their wine, all regulated wine must have one of these four designations. In fact, their system of labeling and judging wine &ndash; called the Appellation de Controlle (AOC) &ndash; is so thorough and precise that it has served as a model for other European nations.</p>
<p>Looking for one of these four classifications is the key when you&rsquo;re reading a French wine label. Once you&rsquo;ve identified the region and the quality, your last step is to take the bottle home and enjoy discovering which French regions you enjoy being transported to the best.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:16:40";"how-to-read-a-french-wine-label";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Wine Labels, French Wines, Reading ";"French wine labels can be complex, even if you already have a knowledge of French.

"33";"What is Rose Wine?";"<p>Rose wines are often referred to as &ldquo;blush wines.&rdquo; They are not white wines, but they are not dark enough to be red wines. Contrary to the opinion of many, not all rose wines share the same characteristics.</p>
<p><a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/other-wine/rose-wine.html"">Rose wine</a> became popular during the 1970&rsquo;s. The demand for white wine increased, but there were not enough grapes available for production. Many winemakers tried to produce white wine by using red grapes. Sutter Homes &ldquo;White Zinfandel&rdquo; was created in 1975 from a stuck fermentation where the yeast died early and left behind a pink, sweeter wine. The three most popular ways to make rose wines are skin contact, saignee, and blending.</p>
<p><strong>Skin Contact</strong></p>
<p>Skin contact is when the skins of the crushed grapes are left in contact with the wine for a certain period of time. The skins will usually have contact with the wine for one to three days. While making red wine, the skins would be left in the wine during the entire fermentation period. The longer the skins are left in contact, the darker the shade of the wine will be.</p>
<p><strong>Saignee</strong></p>
<p>Saignee is also known as bleeding the vats. In order to raise the tannins in a wine, the winemaker releases some of the juice from the must. The juice is lighter in color, and can be made into rose wine. The remaining red wine in the tank will have more tannin.</p>
<p><strong>Blending</strong></p>
<p>Blending is simply mixing red wine into white wine to give it a little bit of color. This practice is frowned upon, but it is an option as a way to make rose wine.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;blush&rdquo; was originally used in North America, but is now used in reference to Austrailian and Italian wines as well. &ldquo;Blush&rdquo; was trademarked in 1978 and the name was used to market a more sweet, rose wine.</p>
<p>While rose wine was first made to be delicate and dry. However, after World War II, people started to prefer a sweeter taste. Grenache, Syrah, Carignan, and Zinfandel grapes are all popular to use in making this type of wine. Rose wines are now more popular than white wines in France, and they also make a great summer drink.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:18:26";"what-is-rose-wine";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Rose Wine, Wines";"Learn all about the history and development of rose wines at City Wine Cellar University.

"34";"Sherry";"<p>Sherry is not just the name of your cousin&rsquo;s friend or some girl in a song (think &ldquo;Sherry Baby&rdquo;). The name belongs to one of the most popular fortified wine drinks, and sherry is now becoming an increasingly popular choice among wine drinkers. A great benefit of sherry is that its versatility allows it to be a desirable ingredient in many dishes, and also a drink cherished by cocktail enthusiasts. Sherry can boast that no other wine in the world is made like it. Of course, this also means that sherry is an acquired taste.</p>
<p>The vast history of sherry is very interesting. It has a wide range of different types and styles, and has been produced since the early 1600s. Sherry originates in southern Spain and it is a wine fortified with brandy. Even though the Moorish invasion of Spain had many downsides, one of the contributions they brought was the invention of sherry &ndash; the Moors introduced distillation to the region. The drink was originally known as Sherish (derived from Arabic).</p>
<p>One of sherry&rsquo;s unique attributes is that it has a much longer shelf life than other wines, and this made it a great choice for transportation over long sea voyages. Sherry is produced in a system called the Solera system, in which newer vintages are mixed with older vintages, which results in a very high-quality wine. This is one of the reasons why you won&rsquo;t see a vintage on a Sherry &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t have a single year it was produced.</p>
<p><strong>The Many Styles of Sherry</strong></p>
<p>There are a wide range of Sherries which range from dry to sweet. Some of the different types include:</p>
<p><strong>Fino-</strong> Fino is traditionally the palest and driest of the varieties. It is aged under flor yeast to prevent oxygen contact.</p>
<p><strong>Amontillado-</strong> This sherry is darker than fino and it is usually dry, although sometimes you will find it sold lightly sweetened.</p>
<p><strong>Oloroso-</strong> Oloroso is darker and means &ldquo;scented&rdquo; in Spanish. This is a rich wine with a lot of alcohol in it.</p>
<p><strong>Manzanilla-</strong> This type of sherry is a lighter version of Fino.</p>
<p><strong>Manzanilla Pasada-</strong> This is a version of Mazanilla that has been aged and exposed to oxygen which gives it a nice, flavorful, nutty taste.</p>
<p><strong>Palo Cortado-</strong> These Sherries are aged over three years</p>
<p><strong>Cream Sherries-</strong> Cream or sweet Sherries are made with Moscatel grapes which give it sweetness is mixed with a drier wine.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of sherries is that they are both great to drink and great to cook with. So you can enjoy discovering not only which sherries you like the best, but also which sherry recipes are the most pleasing. Check out our wide selection of Sherries at www.CityWineCellar.com.</p>

The name belongs to one of the most popular fortified wine drinks, and sherry is now becoming an increasingly popular choice among wine drinkers. A great benefit of sherry is that its versatility allows it to be a desirable ingredient in many dishes, and also a drink cherished by cocktail enthusiasts. Sherry can boast that no other wine in the world is made like it. Of course, this also means that sherry is an acquired taste.</p>

"35";"Shiraz, Syrah&#8230; What&#8217;s in a Name?";"<p>Today, countries across the globe are producing wines made from both imported and native grape varietals, and the practice has spread almost as far as it possibly could in the eight thousand years or so since the first recorded vineyards in Georgia were being cultivated. The New World wine countries are no longer so &lsquo;new&rsquo;, and recent years have seen countries as diverse as India, Brazil and China begin to produce wines for the international market.</p>
<p>With so many countries, cultures and people establishing their own wines, methods and techniques, it should come as no surprise that certain words and terms have been changed over time. Indeed, this is nothing new at all &ndash; there has long been a huge discrepancy between the names of grape varietals in Latin language countries and Germanic language countries, which still causes confusion to this day for those travelling around Europe to taste wines. However, the one grape name which consistently causes confusion and is a source of some annoyance for various Old World purists involves the <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/red-wine.html"">Syrah/Shiraz</a> debate, an argument regarding the &lsquo;real&rsquo; name of this particular grape varietal which has its roots back in France, but which has decidedly flourished in the New World.</p>
<p><strong>France and Australia</strong></p>
<p>In the Northern Rhone Valley of France, the Syrah grape has been cultivated for centuries, and is responsible for the large, full-bodied and fleshy red wines which epitomize the produce of the region. These deep purple, dusty grapes grow in abundance in the mineral rich soil of the Rhone valley, and they have been a stable source of income for vintners of the Rhone for generations. Partly the reason for this is due to the fact that Syrah grapes are reasonably hardy, and consistently produce quite high yields of decent quality, and partly because the jammy, fruit-forward nature of the wine is a big hit on the international market.</p>
<p>However, it is on the other side of the world where these grapes have really found a spiritual home, somewhere they can thrive in numbers unreachable in the relatively small Rhone Valley. In Australia, where the grapes are known by the name &lsquo;Shiraz&rsquo;, the southern regions of this hot and dry land are ideal for growing vast quantities of grapevines, resulting in a wine industry which uses this grape varietal as one of its flagship examples. Australian Shiraz wines are regarded as one of the most reliable and flavorful within any New World country, and being an affordable yet tasty red wine that matches well with a variety of international cuisines, it is a supermarket favorite with an enormous fan-base which reaches around the globe.</p>
<p><strong>The History of the Name</strong></p>
<p>So, if Syrah and Shiraz grapes are the same thing, why this discrepancy when it comes to the name? Where do these two names come from? The answer is one that stretches back into history, and remains surrounded by considerable debate. According to some wine historians and experts in mythology, the name &lsquo;Shiraz&rsquo; comes from Iran, and refers to a town which made a famous &lsquo;Shirazi&rsquo; wine which was much exported around the Mediterranean. Legend has it that these wines reached the port of Marseilles, and were so adored that the French demanded the grapes be imported and allowed to flourish in the fertile Rhone Valley. This suggests that &lsquo;Syrah&rsquo; is merely a French synonym, and that &lsquo;Shiraz&rsquo; is in fact the original and proper name of the grape. However, this gets called into question when many claim that whilst this legend has certainly been told for centuries, the origin of the story itself is French.</p>
<p>Other legends involve the wines coming from Syracuse, being brought by Roman Emperors, or being brought back from the Holy Land by crusaders. It seems all such legends have some basis in historical fact, but are impossible to prove and have plenty of evidence suggesting they are unfounded and untrue. What is curious to note is that the name &lsquo;Shiraz&rsquo; has only really been used by Australians, leading some to claim it comes from nowhere more mysterious or evocative than a simple Anglicization or spelling error. Interestingly, however, the Shiraz wines of Australia have become so popular on the international market, that other New World countries (notably Chile and Argentina) have, in some regions, begun labeling their Syrah wines with &lsquo;Shiraz&rsquo; in order to associate more closely with the quality Australian produce.</p>
<p><strong>A Matter of Perspective</strong></p>
<p>Wherever the name comes from, it is vital to remember that both of these grapes are the same, and produce similar wines despite being grown all over the world. Whilst it can be fun to explore the origins of a grape&rsquo;s name, it has no bearing on the flavors or aromas that the finished product can provide, and this must surely be the most important factor when it comes to this particular grape varietal. It is perhaps also worth mentioning that the Syrah/Shiraz grape has, in fact, far more than just two names. Sometimes it is known as Balsamina, Candive, Hignin Noir, Sirac, Serine, or Entournerein. Although this all sounds complicated, you can rest easy, because these wines are all delicious.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:20:38";"shiraz-syrah-whats-in-a-name";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Shiraz, Syrah, Wine";"City Wine Cellar University teaches you all you need to know about Shiraz, Syrah, and the history of the name of this delicious wine.";"0";"Shiraz, Syrah, Wine";"<p>Today, countries across the globe are producing wines made from both imported and native grape varietals, and the practice has spread almost as far as it possibly could in the eight thousand years or so since the first recorded vineyards in Georgia were being cultivated.

"36";"Differences between Old World and New World Wines";"<p><strong>Old World Wine</strong></p>
<p>Old World wines are produced in countries that have extensive histories and traditions of winemaking. Old World wines come primarily from parts of Europe and the Mediterranean. The term does not necessarily refer to the style of wine; it refers to the role of terroir and the practice of tradition. Old World wine countries can usually trace their history back hundreds of years. Former Roman, Greek, and Phoenician provinces can trace their winemaking histories back thousands of years. The process of making Old World wines is highly regulated. Harvesting and pruning must be done manually, whereas New World winemaking uses machines. Some wine lovers find a more subtle, soft style in Old World wines. A few countries that would fall under the Old World category are France, Italy, Spain, Germany, and Greece.</p>
<p><strong>New World Wine</strong></p>
<p>New World wines are not produced in traditional regions. Most of the regions that make New World wines can only trace their history back a short time. These wines might be made with new, innovative techniques or an usual blend of varietals. Hybrids, the crossing of grape varietals, are considered New World wines. New World wines are not dependent on geographical location; they have a stronger emphasis on branding.</p>
<p>New World wine pioneers would use grapes from any location and invent new blends. Max Shubert wanted to make the best table wine in South Australia so he invented Grange Hermitage, a blend of Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. In 1951, the success of Grange marked the first recognition of the New World style. This encouraged other winemakers. New World wine countries include Argentina, Mexico, Chile, the United States, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Differences</strong></p>
<p>Many wine lovers believe that New World wines have a more bold flavor than Old World wines, which are more subtle and graceful. Certain wines from Old World countries can be considered New World, such as Super Tuscans, because they are made with varietals that were not used in traditional wines. Your preference is entirely up to you, but knowing the differences of the two worlds is important knowledge to wine connoisseurs.</p>
<p>New World wines have been named for Old World regions, such as Champagne, Sherry, Port, and Burgundy. The reason was to make consumers believe that the wines might have an Old World taste, but many of the countries objected to the use of their names. New World wineries used grapes from many different locations, so using the name of a region can help describe the flavor of the wine. The production of Grange Hermitage inspired confidence in the varietal labeling. This new labeling system spread further during the 1960s and 1970s with the help of Robert Mondavi and other winemakers.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:21:49";"differences-between-old-world-and-new-world-wine";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Old World Wine, New World Wines, Choosing Wine";"With access to wines from all over the world, making a choice can be tricky.

"37";"How White Wine is Produced";"<p>White wine, red wine, or in between: all wine is fermented grape juice, but there is a difference between red and white wines, not just in characteristics and flavor, but also production.&nbsp;What wine producers want from the grapes are also very different between red and white wines. In a white wine grape the goal is not to extract color and tannins but rather to retain the fruity flavor and freshness of the grapes.</p>
<p>After being picked, <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/white-wine.html"">white wine grapes</a> generally have their stems removed (sometimes, not all the time) and then they are gently crushed; just enough to have the skin of the grapes break open. The purpose of crushing the grapes is to allow the winemakers to extract more of the juice from the grapes. For certain wines (such as Champagne and Sparkling wines), this step is skipped and the grapes go to another stage known as whole-cluster pressing. In whole-cluster, the grapes are bunched together and pressed very gently to extract the juices. This does is it minimizes the amount of harsh malic acid and astringent tannins. After the crushing of the grapes comes the &ldquo;cold soak&rdquo; or prefermentation maceration (PFM) which extracts additional aromas and flavors from the skins into the juice. The grapes are pressed from their skins, and sometimes there is a period of cold settling which would allow any solids from the juice to fall to the bottom which would then be racked off leaving a clearer juice known as must. After the grapes are prepared and crushed, it is time for the fermentation.</p>
<p>Now, the grapes must be fermented with their skins, pulp and seeds.&nbsp;The fermentation stage of the production of white wines beginning with some yeast that is added into the must, this causes the sugars in the grapes to convert and change into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Fermentation has a lot of important variables, such as the temperature, vessel, and location. Whether the grapes are fermented in oak, stainless steel or some other type of container, nearly every decision changes the flavor and texture of the wine being produced. Certain containers go well with certain types of grapes. Chardonnay grapes are often fermented in small oak barrels, while Riesling or Sauvignon Blanc grapes are usually fermented in stainless steel vessels.</p>
<p>Temperature is very important to the overall quality of a white wine. White wines are usually fermented at cooler temperatures than red wines. The cooler the temperature, the more of the fruity aroma and flavor is preserved. On the other hand, he warmer temperatures produce a wine with more structure and body. Sometimes, during this stage, the wine will undergo malolactic fermentation, which converts the remaining tart malic acid in the wine into the softer lactic acid. For example, Chardonnay has a buttery note because it goes through this process.</p>
<p>Equally important is the next stage of production, which varies with the kind of white wine the winemaker wishes to produce. The producer can leave the wine on its lees, which is spent yeast cells, to give it a creamy texture and tastes with an aromas of butter. Or, the winemaker can let the wine chill near freezing temperatures, which is called &lsquo;cold stabilization&rsquo;, which prevents the wine from forming crystals. Then again the wine producers could age the wine in a wooden barrel, rather than leaving it in its original vessel, which would dramatically affect the taste and aroma of the wine adding marked vanilla, wood and/or even toasty flavors. Another alternative is filtering the wine to make it even clearer, but this process would remove some nuances of the flavor.</p>
<p>The last production stage of white wine is the aging, aging is very important to all wines. The wine can be aged in its original vessel or moved to a wooden vessel, depending on what the wine producers wishes, and will be left there for the aging process. From time to time, the winemakers can choose to stir the wine up, which allows the spent yeast to add more flavors and qualities to the wine. When the wine is ready, which is after its aging process, the wine will then be bottled and ready for shipment. But they are not shipped right after they are bottled. Usually wines that have been recently bottled will remain in the winery for some time on racks so that it gets some more aging in the bottle.

"38";"Liquors and Liqueurs";"<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see why someone would get confused between <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/spirits.html"">&ldquo;liquors&rdquo; and &ldquo;liqueurs.&rdquo;</a> A slight change in spelling and a slight change in pronunciation make a big difference, but people frequently blend these two together and talk about one when they really want to talk about the other. I used to be one of those people, but now the differences between these two terms are as clear as day.</p>
<p>These two liquids do have several similarities that you should know. Both of these are considered &ldquo;spirits,&rdquo; which is a term used for distilled beverages. The term &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; is derived from the chemical process of fermenting a fruit or grain and watching the vapor of these ingredients rise. The vapor would then be captured, and the steam is then condensed into a liquid. So quite literally a &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; becomes the drink itself. This term was also commonly used in alchemy.</p>
<p>Liquor is an alcoholic liquid that typically does not have any added sugars or extracts. Vodka, rum, and whiskey are examples of liquors. The fact that liquors have no sugars or extracts added is the distinguishing difference between liquors and liqueurs. In fact, if you were to add sugars and extracts to a liquor, you would have a liqueur. Liquors can be used as a base for liqueurs.</p>
<p>This means that a liqueur is different because it does contain added ingredients and sweeteners. These might also be called cordials, although today we refer to cordials as being non-alcoholic. Liqueurs are infused with herbs and flavorings, and were originally concocted for medicinal purposes. An example of a liqueur is schnapps, which is usually brandy-based and infused with fruits. Flavors like peppermint, peach, and apple are created by steeping the fruits in brandy. Aperitifs are liqueurs with added herbs that stimulate appetite while digestifs aid with digestion after the meal.</p>

Learn all about them at City Wine Cellar University.";"0";"Liqueur, Liquor";"<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see why someone would get confused between &ldquo;liquors&rdquo; and &ldquo;liqueurs.&rdquo; A slight change in spelling and a slight change in pronunciation make a big difference, but people frequently blend these two together and talk about one when they really want to talk about the other. I used to be one of those people, but now the differences between these two terms are as clear as day.</p>
<p>These two liquids do have several similarities that you should know. Both of these are considered &ldquo;spirits,&rdquo; which is a term used for distilled beverages. The term &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; is derived from the chemical process of fermenting a fruit or grain and watching the vapor of these ingredients rise. The vapor would then be captured, and the steam is then condensed into a liquid. So quite literally a &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; becomes the drink itself. This term was also commonly used in alchemy.</p>
<p>Liquor is an alcoholic liquid that typically does not have any added sugars or extracts. Vodka, rum, and whiskey are examples of liquors. The fact that liquors have no sugars or extracts added is the distinguishing difference between liquors and liqueurs. In fact, if you were to add sugars and extracts to a liquor, you would have a liqueur. Liquors can be used as a base for liqueurs.</p>
<p>This means that a liqueur is different because it does contain added ingredients and sweeteners. These might also be called cordials, although today we refer to cordials as being non-alcoholic. Liqueurs are infused with herbs and flavorings, and were originally concocted for medicinal purposes. An example of a liqueur is schnapps, which is usually brandy-based and infused with fruits. Flavors like peppermint, peach, and apple are created by steeping the fruits in brandy. Aperitifs are liqueurs with added herbs that stimulate appetite while digestifs aid with digestion after the meal.</p>
<p>We tend to loosely exchange these terms in conversation, but now you can have a better understanding between their differences. Hopefully now you know when you should or should not use one of these terms, and the next time it comes up in conversation, you&rsquo;ll be able to use the right one.</p>"
"39";"The Noble Grapes and the Wines They Make";"<p>There are countless varieties of grapes in the world, many of which have been used for wine production for thousands of years. Ever since the ancient civilisations of Georgia first began cultivating wild grapevines over eight thousand years ago, efforts have been made to make the most of indigenous strains wherever they grow. Over time, knowledge of how to cross-breed, clone and enhance nature&rsquo;s bounty has spread grapes around the world, and vintners and wine scientists have created new strains developed specifically for wine production, prized for their flavor, their aromas, their ability to age well or their ability to express specific characteristics of the terroir on which they grow.</p>
<p>Wine production is an ever-developing field of agriculture, and even today we are seeing new strains of grape come forward or be re-discovered and heralded as important steps towards achieving viticultural perfection. Who knows what will happen in the near future? Now that China, India and Brazil are stepping up their wine industries, we can expect to see some huge jumps in viticultural technique and technology over the next few years, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if some new or forgotten grape varietals begin to appear on bottles on the shelves of our wine stores or supermarkets.</p>
<p>Despite the enormous range of grape varietals in the world, there have always been those strains which are so revered, so appreciated for the quality and character of the wine which they produce, that they have gone down in history as the grapes of choice for those wineries wishing to produce world-beating and widely loved produce. These are the &lsquo;noble grapes&rsquo; &ndash; a term being used less and less in today&rsquo;s wine industry, but one which still hold some reverence among those pursuing perfection in a bottle. These grapes are handy signifiers of quality for those unsure about trying something new or unusual. To see a noble grape listed as the only or primary grape varietal on a bottle gives the buyer some idea of what to expect, as the characteristics, flavors and aromas of these grapes have been written about and discussed extensively. The &lsquo;noble grapes&rsquo; offer something to both the expert and the novice, as they can be appreciated for their subtler points and their classic characteristics, just as they can allow a beginner to the world of wine a safe introduction in regards to what to expect from a quality bottle.</p>
<p>A noble grape is one which has proven to produce exceptional quality wines without the use of blending. This is important, as an unblended wine allows the true character of the single grape to shine. When we blend grape juices, the aim is to highlight the best features of each selected grape, to cover up its weaker points, or to balance out certain aspects of its natural character. Unblended bottles rely on the excellence of the varietal in regards to all its features: flavor and aroma, to dryness or sweetness, body, length and complexity.</p>
<p>Because the noble grape varietals were classified some time ago, it comes as little surprise that they are almost all French. This has led plenty of people to question the list&rsquo;s relevance today, as plenty of other countries have since proven that their native grapes are more than capable of producing exceptional quality single variety wines, and this should probably be kept in mind. A modern list of &lsquo;noble grapes&rsquo; would most likely be considerably longer than the small selection we have inherited from the golden age of French winemaking.</p>
<p>In white wine, there are three noble grape varietals. These are Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Riesling. Each of these white grapes have vastly different characteristics, and make very different white wines, each considered to be among the best in the world. With Chardonnay, we have the soft, rounded, almost buttery nature which comes about through the process of malolactic fermentation associated with the grape, proving to be a favorite for its subtlety and surprising versatility. Riesling has the ability to express terroir through its crispness, and Sauvignon Blanc produces a wide range of excellent white wines, whether grassy, fruity, plump or aged.</p>
<p>When it comes to red wine, the noble varietals include Merlot, which is renowned for its ability to produce wonderfully soft and rounded medium bodied wines, packed full of jammy and fruity flavors. The elegant and romantic Pinot Noir also makes the list, loved by all for its lightness, its gorgeous garnet color and its delicate flavors. The strong, astringent Cabernet Sauvignon is also included for its dryness, its full body and the fact that there is surely no other varietal which ages so well in oak, taking on earthy, spicy and fascinating complexity notes in the process.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:24:15";"the-noble-grapes-and-the-wines-they-make";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Noble Grapes, Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Riesling, Minot, Pinot, Wine Production";"What are the noble grapes, and do they really make the best wines?

"40";"What is Noble Rot?";"<p>Botrytis Cinerea, also know as &ldquo;Noble Rot,&rdquo; is a grey fungus that grows only on certain fruits. A moist environment enables this fungus to grow into the initial stage called &ldquo;Grey Rot.&rdquo; Noble Rot can help produce sweetness in wines. The grapes usually become infected while they are ripe and shrivel into raisins when exposed to dryer conditions. Some winemakers purposely use this method to make sweeter wines.</p>
<p>Infected grapes have been used in winemaking since around 1570, but it was not until 1730 that vineyards in Southeast Slovakia began to classify those wines. Noble Rot grapes are used to produce very distinctive dessert wines such as Tokay, Tokaji, Aszu, and Sauternes.</p>
<p>Botrytis Cinerea is Latin for &ldquo;grapes like ashes,&rdquo; which is a reference to their color. The fungus dehydrates the grapes, leaving behind high concentrations of sugar, acid, and minerals. The most concentrated products possess a honey smell and a bitter finish. Noble Rot can also also affect fruits like strawberries and tomatoes. Workers who pick Noble Rot grapes can contract a rare hypersensitivity pneumonitis called &ldquo;winegrower&rsquo;s lung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While there are many stories about the practice of making wine from Noble Rot, one popular tale involves the Schloss Johannisberg winery in the Rheingau region. The Riesling producer awaited approval from Heinrich von Bibra, bishop of Fulda and the estate owner, before cutting the grapes. Von Bibra sent his abbey to give approval, but the abbey was robbed en route to deliver the message. The harvest was lost to rot and given to the peasants. However, the peasants made sweet wine from the rotted grapes. It became known as Spatlese or &ldquo;late harvest&rdquo; wine.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:24:40";"what-is-noble-rot";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Noble Rot, Wine Production, Old World Wines, Wine";"Learn about Noble Rot and its effects on wine and winemakers at City Wine Cellar University.";"0";"Winemaking, Noble Rot";"<p>Botrytis Cinerea, also know as &ldquo;Noble Rot,&rdquo; is a grey fungus that grows only on certain fruits.

"42";"Joining a Wine Club";"<p>Wine is enjoyable on any occasion, but sharing wine in a group can truly amplify the experience. Joining a wine club may be just the step you need to to take to transform wine drinking into a fun, memorable, social experience. Clubs offer an array of benefits that any regular wine drinker will find advantageous.</p>
<p><strong>The Social Wine Club</strong></p>
<p>Some of the strongest friendships are forged over common interests. If drinking wine is one of your interests, then it is likely you will have fun sharing this experience with like-minded people. You may also find yourself learning a great deal about wine you didn&rsquo;t know before.</p>
<p>The sharing, the conversations, and the relationships all enhance the overall wine drinking experience. Many people in social clubs are exposed to ideas or techniques, or even entirely new wines that they would never have discovered otherwise. Information related to flavors, aromas, terminology, and other wine drinking opportunities will all arrive thanks to sharing your experience with other enthusiasts. You, too, might have plenty to offer other individuals.</p>
<p>There are many free wine clubs where all you do have to bring is a nice bottle of wine and join in the fun. Another benefit is that most of the time discussions about wine topics are usually led by the manager, director, or administrator of the club, so there is no pressure on you to sound overly fancy about wine. Check out what your community has by asking around or investigating online.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Wine Clubs </strong></p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re investigating online, you might also consider joining an internet wine club. Internet wine clubs provide you with exposure to a wide variety of red and white wines that you might never have considered before. Internet wine clubs are also famous for the discount opportunities they offer. Through your club, you might be able to make a wine subscription to receive variety of wines at a variety of discounts.</p>
<p>Make sure, though, that you&rsquo;re aware of your state&rsquo;s laws about internet wine and orders: transporting alcohol via mail may be subject to certain regulations, and you want to make sure that you&rsquo;re enjoying your drinks legally. As you receive your wines, enjoy sampling the award-winning, popular, and unusual wines that come your way!</p>
<p>Both types of wine clubs offer great opportunities to explore and become a more educated wine connoisseur. Before joining a club, make sure you do some research and find out all the details. Ask your friends or your local wine shop if they can give you any information about these clubs.

"43";"Healthy Wine";"<p>When drunk in moderation, wine can help improve your health. Most of the research that has been done on the benefits of drinking wine focuses on the antioxidant resveratrol, which can also be found in grape juice and certain plants. Experiments have reported that resveratrol has beneficial cardiovascular, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects. It can be found in the skin of red fruits, especially grapes.</p>
<p>Any wine that is <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/red-wine.html"">red in color</a> or has the skins left in the wine during production will be richer in resveratrol than white wine. While the levels of resveratrol are low, moderate wine consumption can still benefit your health. Cabernet Sauvignon and dry wines will contain some amount of this antioxidant.</p>
<p>More research is needed on resveratrol, but you must also consider the possible negative aspects of drinking wine for health. When abused, it can cause alcoholism and weight gain, leading to health problems in the future. These wines may contain pesticides or chemicals added during processing that might have negative health effects. It is also possible for organic wines to have chemicals added to them. Although there are good benefits, not all red wines are healthy.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:34:37";"healthy-wine";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Wine, Health";"Can drinking wine be good for you?

"44";"How many calories are in wine?";"<p>With our culture telling us to eat smarter, count calories, and exercise often, and with a media reporting that America&rsquo;s obesity rate is increasing quickly, it&rsquo;s little wonder that we should begin to question the impact of wine on our weight. Red wine has received a lot of good medical press recently for its positive influence on our cardiovascular health. But before you indulge in too much red wine as part of your health plan, make sure you&rsquo;re aware of the calories you&rsquo;re consuming as well. Make sure that when you begin regularly consuming anything, including wine, you&rsquo;re educated on how it could affect your total health.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about fat content in wine &ndash; there isn&rsquo;t any. However, do pay attention to the sugar content. Wine is not candy, but like any natural product from fruits or vegetables, it contains natural sugars. Sugar tastes great and generally only becomes detrimental to our waistlines when we consume more sugar than we burn. Sugar is not naturally fattening, but when our body does not consume all of the calories sugar brings in, it stores those calories as fat, thus leading to weight gain. At 16 calories per teaspoon, sugar might introduce more calories to our systems than are welcome.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take this as bad news, though. Just like any other consumption, moderation and knowledge are the keys to good health. Below you will find estimated information on the amount of calories contained in a bottle of wine. Use this to help make educated decisions about how much wine would fit your diet.</p>
<p><strong>Calories per varietal:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Port, Muscatel, fortified wines:</strong> These wines, especially fortified wines may be high in alcohol. These wines are also on the sweeter side and contain more sugar than other wines. These wines can contain anywhere from 900 calories to 1,200 calories per bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Cream sherry, Sweet, fortified wines: </strong>While not as high in calories as the above category, these wines can also contain high levels of alcohol, and sugar levels approach 1,065 calories per bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Dry, fortified, Sherry wines:</strong> These wines can contain high levels of alcohol and around anywhere from 600 to 780 calories per bottle. If one serving size glass is around 6 oz., than you can get around 4 to 5 glasses out of a 750ml size bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Champagne, Sparkling wines:</strong> Frequently these pleasant, refreshing drinks are unavoidable for celebrations and toasts. On average a bottle of champagne can contain anywhere from 450 to 531 calories per bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Red wines, Rose, medium bodied wines:</strong> These wines are actually among the healthiest for you. Red wine contains high levels of resveratrol which studies have shown can help reduce the thickening of arteries and help improve cardiovascular disease. Red wines contain around 500 to 562 calories per bottle, which compared to other wines is quite reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>White wines, dry, table white wines:</strong> These fantastic companions to light meals and appetizers will run anywhere between 480 to 560 calories per bottle.</p>
<p>You may or may not intend to drink an entire bottle, but you can estimate the number of calories per glass by considering a glass to be roughly 6 oz. Some simple division will help you calculate how many calories you&rsquo;re adding to your diet with each glass. Of course, your own glass size might vary. Also, the true calorie count depends specifically on which wine you are drinking as well.</p>
<p>Calorie count gives only a partial picture of how a wine will affect your total health. Moderate wine consumption can provide an impressive range of health benefits, including decreased risk of stroke, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Doctors urge older patients to drink about a glass of red wine a day with dinner: 140g to 210 grams per week for men and 84g- 140 grams per week for women.</p>
<p>Of course, over-consumption of wine or any type of alcohol abuse will introduce problems to your health, as well as possibly other areas of life. And as you have likely heard before, consumption is not recommended for pregnant women or women who breastfeed.</p>
<p>Below is a chart that helps clarify some of the comparables between wines.</p>

Learn more about calories in wine right here.";"0";"Wine,Wine and Health";"<p>With our culture telling us to eat smarter, count calories, and exercise often, and with a media reporting that America&rsquo;s obesity rate is increasing quickly, it&rsquo;s little wonder that we should begin to question the impact of wine on our weight. Red wine has received a lot of good medical press recently for its positive influence on our cardiovascular health. But before you indulge in too much red wine as part of your health plan, make sure you&rsquo;re aware of the calories you&rsquo;re consuming as well. Make sure that when you begin regularly consuming anything, including wine, you&rsquo;re educated on how it could affect your total health.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about fat content in wine &ndash; there isn&rsquo;t any. However, do pay attention to the sugar content. Wine is not candy, but like any natural product from fruits or vegetables, it contains natural sugars. Sugar tastes great and generally only becomes detrimental to our waistlines when we consume more sugar than we burn. Sugar is not naturally fattening, but when our body does not consume all of the calories sugar brings in, it stores those calories as fat, thus leading to weight gain. At 16 calories per teaspoon, sugar might introduce more calories to our systems than are welcome.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take this as bad news, though. Just like any other consumption, moderation and knowledge are the keys to good health. Below you will find estimated information on the amount of calories contained in a bottle of wine. Use this to help make educated decisions about how much wine would fit your diet.</p>
<p><strong>Calories per varietal:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Port, Muscatel, fortified wines:</strong> These wines, especially fortified wines may be high in alcohol. These wines are also on the sweeter side and contain more sugar than other wines. These wines can contain anywhere from 900 calories to 1,200 calories per bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Cream sherry, Sweet, fortified wines: </strong>While not as high in calories as the above category, these wines can also contain high levels of alcohol, and sugar levels approach 1,065 calories per bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Dry, fortified, Sherry wines:</strong> These wines can contain high levels of alcohol and around anywhere from 600 to 780 calories per bottle. If one serving size glass is around 6 oz., than you can get around 4 to 5 glasses out of a 750ml size bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Champagne, Sparkling wines:</strong> Frequently these pleasant, refreshing drinks are unavoidable for celebrations and toasts. On average a bottle of champagne can contain anywhere from 450 to 531 calories per bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Red wines, Rose, medium bodied wines:</strong> These wines are actually among the healthiest for you. Red wine contains high levels of resveratrol which studies have shown can help reduce the thickening of arteries and help improve cardiovascular disease. Red wines contain around 500 to 562 calories per bottle, which compared to other wines is quite reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>White wines, dry, table white wines:</strong> These fantastic companions to light meals and appetizers will run anywhere between 480 to 560 calories per bottle.</p>
<p>You may or may not intend to drink an entire bottle, but you can estimate the number of calories per glass by considering a glass to be roughly 6 oz. Some simple division will help you calculate how many calories you&rsquo;re adding to your diet with each glass. Of course, your own glass size might vary. Also, the true calorie count depends specifically on which wine you are drinking as well.</p>
<p>Calorie count gives only a partial picture of how a wine will affect your total health. Moderate wine consumption can provide an impressive range of health benefits, including decreased risk of stroke, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Doctors urge older patients to drink about a glass of red wine a day with dinner: 140g to 210 grams per week for men and 84g- 140 grams per week for women.</p>
<p>Of course, over-consumption of wine or any type of alcohol abuse will introduce problems to your health, as well as possibly other areas of life. And as you have likely heard before, consumption is not recommended for pregnant women or women who breastfeed.</p>

"45";"How to Become a Sommelier";"<p>Sometimes you might study a menu at a restaurant and desire to know which wines are best paired with which menu selections. Then, likely one of two things has occurred: either the waiter &ndash; sometimes called a wine waiter &ndash; has been able to inform you about a certain wines&rsquo; prices and the basic label information, or a gentleman with a funny looking ribbon around his neck has been able to inform you in detail about which wines are best paired with certain menu choices.</p>
<p>A wine waiter is really little more than a waiter at a restaurant who only knows a little bit about what he can remember from the wine labels. This is only head knowledge and tells you extremely little about how a wine tastes. The gentleman with the ribbon who intimately knows wines&rsquo; tastes, textures, and pairings is known as a sommelier (pronounced suh-moll-ee-ay), and he likely understands not only the ideal food pairings, but even &nbsp;details like a wine&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Many sommeliers will forego wearing the ribbon, but the ribbon represents a portion of this profession&rsquo;s history. Since wine was typically stored in dim cellars, it was rather difficult for sommeliers to judge a wine&rsquo;s clarity and color in the poor lighting. Sommeliers wore a tastevin around their neck, which is a small cup with a reflective interior that amplified the amount of light directed at the wine. Even though modern lighting makes tastevins obsolete, many sommeliers wear the ribbon as a matter of tradition.</p>
<p>Sommeliers seem to have an extraordinary talent, but becoming one yourself is actually not too difficult once you understand the basic information. Of course, there are different levels of sommeliers just as there are different level chefs or karate masters. There are four different levels of certification. The introductory level begins with participating in a two-day seminar, but each successive level is increasingly difficult to achieve. Achieving the rank of master sommelier means that you will pass a variety of challenging tests, such as blindly identifying six different wines just by tasting them. Another challenge involves prospective masters giving tips for correctly opening and pouring still and sparkling wines while also being asked difficult questions from the previous tests. As you might have guessed, the passing rates of those taking the masters certification tests are rather low.</p>
<p>However, if wine is your passion and you have the strong desire to have the title of master sommelier, then the time you spend practicing and studying will be one of the most rewarding activities you could take up. In fact, becoming a sommelier might turn out to be a fantastic way to indulge in your hobby as well provide that unique boost to your resume.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:35:31";"how-to-become-a-sommelier";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Sommelier";"Love wines and want to share your love with the world?

But many of us stick to the standard wines we know and avoid the foreign ones &ndash; like the Italian wines &ndash; because we cannot discern what the foreign labels actually say. Although you might be able to make out what an Italian restaurant menu says, if you are not fluent in Italian, reading <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/wine-by-region"">an Italian wine label</a> can be an intimidating process.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are only a few simple things you need to know that will transform reading an Italian wine label from a mystery into a pleasure. The biggest thing you need to know is that Italians label their wine in one of five classifications. Once you discern which classification the Italian Wine label has, the easier it will be to read the rest of the information.</p>
<p><strong>The five classifications consist of the following:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG)</strong>- This is the highest classification for traditional Italian wine. It was established in 1963 and is designated for high-quality wines. The word garantita stands for &ldquo;guarantee.&rdquo; Every wine that falls under the DOCG classification has gone through very strict government rules before distribution, and each bottle has a numbered government seal across the neck. If a wine label has this on it, then it will likely contain much more additional information about the wine&rsquo;s production as well.</p>
<p><strong>Denominazione de Origine Controllata (DOC)</strong> &ndash; A majority of the wine in Italy falls under this classification. It is very similar to the French and their (AOC). The DOC and the DOCG place restrictions on the grape varieties, alcohol percentages and processing techniques involved in the wine&rsquo;s production.</p>
<p><strong>Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT)</strong> &ndash; This classification was created around 1992 and is also known as the &ldquo;Goria Law&rdquo;. Named after the minister of agriculture, this classification covers all the wines that don&rsquo;t fall the DOC and the DOGC. The possibility that these wines don&rsquo;t fall under the other classifications may be because of the varietals used and so these wines are considered Vino da Tavolas (VDT).</p>
<p><strong>Vino da Tavola (VDT)</strong>- This classification covers all wines considered table wines. These wines do not follow the strict regulations. Some quality wines do fall under this classification because they don&rsquo;t follow traditional guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Super Tuscans</strong>- A super tuscan is an Italian wine that doesn&rsquo;t follow traditional Italian wine making techniques. They usually are a blend with grapes like Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot. Some Super-Tuscans can be of high quality.</p>
<p>When you find yourself staring at a shelf full of Italian wine labels, you don&rsquo;t have to shy away from reading them. Instead, identify the type of classification it hosts on its label, and then you&rsquo;ll know much more about the type and quality of wine you&rsquo;ll soon be enjoying!</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:36:26";"how-to-read-an-italian-wine-label";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Italian Wines, Wine Bottles, Wine Geography, Wines";"Italian Wine labels can be confusing.

"47";"How to Read Wine Label from Spain";"<p>Sometimes staring down a confusing foreign wine label can be just as frustrating as looking at a broken car engine when you know nothing about cars: you know there&rsquo;s a message there, but you just don&rsquo;t have the experience or knowledge to know what you&rsquo;re looking at. However, just like knowing about cars can help you fix the engine, knowing about wine labels can help you select the ideal wines. Sometimes we have the impulse to buy a wine just based on its label (even though we don&rsquo;t know what the label says) and then we only disappoint ourselves. Although wine labels will vary by the producer, <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/wine-by-region"">Spanish wine labels</a> all generally contain the same basic information.</p>
<p><strong>Spanish wine laws and classification:</strong></p>
<p>D.O. or Denominacion de Origen is a term assigned to Spanish wines and foods. It is very similar to France and their A.O.C. (Appellation d&rsquo;Origine Controlee). It is a classification system which establishes and regulates the quality of Spanish wine. The D.O. guarantees specific characteristics of geographical regions and no materials outside of that region will be permitted in the bottle. This classification system helps protect vineyards and consumers. The D.O. is the mainstream grading system and there are about 120 regions that are classified under this system. New subgroups were adopted in 1986.</p>
<p>D.O.C. or Denominacion de Origen Calificada is determined by the national committee. They determine which D.O.s are deserving for D.O.C. status. These wines usually follow strict requirements, one of which &nbsp;is that the wine costs at least double that of the national average.<br />In 2003 Spain revised the laws and sanctioned new categories which include:</p>
<p><strong>Vinos de la Tierra (VDLT)</strong> &ndash; These are considered the wines of the country. This is one level above Vino de Mesa.</p>
<p><strong>Vino de Mesa (VDM) &ndash;</strong> This wine is the lowest quality and considered table wine.</p>
<p>They also created a category called <strong>D.O. Pago</strong> which applies to a single estate wine. Pago means vineyard, and this term applies to a wine that is wholly created and bottled in that region or area.</p>
<p><strong>Spanish Wine Aging Terms:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you may see a word like Reserva or Crianza on a Spanish wine label. These words explain the age of the wine. There are minimum requirements a wine must have to receive one of these terms:</p>
<p><strong>Joven</strong>: This term is for younger wine which is usually sold one year after harvest.<br /><strong>Crianza</strong>: This wine is aged a minimum of two years with one year in a barrel.<br /><strong>Reserva</strong>: This wine is usually three years old and spends at least one year in the barrel.<br /><strong>Gran</strong> <strong>Reserva</strong>: This wine is five years old and spends two years in a barrel.</p>
<p>These terms are observed by the DOC and the DO. The Reservas and Gran Reservas of Spain are some of the greatest valued wines in the world. While not all wine is meant to be aged, the reservas, when aged, produce one of the best and most memorable wine tastes.</p>
<p><strong>Reading the label:</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Name</strong>: This shows the name of the wine.<br />2. <strong>Vintage</strong>: This shows the year of production.<br />3. <strong>Bodega</strong>: The bodega is another term for winery.<br />4. <strong>Region</strong>: The region is the location where the grapes have been grown.<br />5. <strong>Alcohol</strong> <strong>Content</strong>: This shows the amount of alcohol in the wine.<br />6. <strong>Size</strong>: This shows the size of the bottle.</p>
<p>Sometimes the label might show the varietal which is the type of grape used to make the wine. Some popular varietals include Garnacha, Albarino, Priorat, Malvasia, and Viura.</p>
<p>Reading a Spanish wine label &ndash; now that you know what you&rsquo;re looking at &ndash; can be rather simple now. Just the translation of a few words, the identification of a label&rsquo;s classification, and the discerning of its basic information will help you figure out which Spanish wine is right for you.

And the truth is that it <em>is</em> a lot easier to read American wine labels, not only because they&rsquo;re in English, but because they also feature information that we might be more used to looking for. Wine labels &ndash; when you know what you&rsquo;re looking at &ndash; can be very useful sources of information for telling us about the location, wineries, varietals, vintages, and many other useful terms that help us choose the wine that is best.</p>
<p>In 1983, the federal government ruled that all domestic wine labels must contain, at minimum, a certain amount of information. Learning how to accurately read a label is only to your advantage &ndash; inaccurate labels are illegal, so this helps to enforce quality.</p>
<p>Remember that just because a bottle or a label looks good does not necessarily mean the wine inside is worth it. Here are the basic informational components you want to keep your eyes open for:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Name of Vineyard:</strong>&nbsp;This is optional information that vineyards may add because the property of the winery might produce high-quality grapes. Some vineyards might be well-known for the quality of their production, so they would most likely mention the vineyard on the label.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Vintage</strong>: The vintage is the year the grapes were harvested, and it is very important because wine differs year to year due to climate changes. There are published charts you can consult to determine which year was the best in certain regions.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Region</strong>: Region or Appellation of Origin (AOC) explains the region within certain states or geographical distinctions. California laws require that 100% of the grapes come from within California. Other states require at least 75% of the grapes come from that state. When a label states a particular area like &ldquo;Napa Valley,&rdquo; it means that at least 85 % of the grapes used come from that area.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Varietals</strong>: The varietal is the wine type. In the label above it says &ldquo;Cabernet Sauvignon.&rdquo; In 1983 the law stated that a varietal must contain at least 75% of the varietal listed. Remember that 100% varietals are not automatically better wines. Some of the best wines use different percentages of different grapes to create exotic flavors. Prior to 1983, the law required only 51% of the named varietal.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Alcohol Percentage</strong>: The alcohol percentage states the amount of alcohol the wine contains by volume. This is a mandatory requirement for all wines.</p>
<p>The government also intervened in 1988 and established a mandatory law declaring the quantity of sulfites that wine must contain, and all wines that have level above 10 parts per million of sulfur dioxide must clearly publish this on the label. You&rsquo;ll also notice that wine labels have a federal warning, similar to the statements you used to see on cigarettes &ndash; this warning is thanks to another 1989 federal law.</p>
<p>Remember that even though there is a minimum requirement for how much information is published on the label, the actually quantity and design will differ depending on the producer. Thankfully, the words and appearances on United States&rsquo; wine labels can be comforting and relatively easy to read.

Wine labels &ndash; when you know what you&rsquo;re looking at &ndash; can be very useful sources of information for telling us about the location, wineries, varietals, vintages, and many other useful terms that help us choose the wine that is best.</p>
<p>In 1983, the federal government ruled that all domestic wine labels must contain, at minimum, a certain amount of information. Learning how to accurately read a label is only to your advantage &ndash; inaccurate labels are illegal, so this helps to enforce quality.</p>
<p>Remember that just because a bottle or a label looks good does not necessarily mean the wine inside is worth it. Here are the basic informational components you want to keep your eyes open for:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Name of Vineyard:</strong>&nbsp;This is optional information that vineyards may add because the property of the winery might produce high-quality grapes. Some vineyards might be well-known for the quality of their production, so they would most likely mention the vineyard on the label.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Vintage</strong>: The vintage is the year the grapes were harvested, and it is very important because wine differs year to year due to climate changes. There are published charts you can consult to determine which year was the best in certain regions.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Region</strong>: Region or Appellation of Origin (AOC) explains the region within certain states or geographical distinctions. California laws require that 100% of the grapes come from within California. Other states require at least 75% of the grapes come from that state. When a label states a particular area like &ldquo;Napa Valley,&rdquo; it means that at least 85 % of the grapes used come from that area.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Varietals</strong>: The varietal is the wine type. In the label above it says &ldquo;Cabernet Sauvignon.&rdquo; In 1983 the law stated that a varietal must contain at least 75% of the varietal listed. Remember that 100% varietals are not automatically better wines. Some of the best wines use different percentages of different grapes to create exotic flavors. Prior to 1983, the law required only 51% of the named varietal.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Alcohol Percentage</strong>: The alcohol percentage states the amount of alcohol the wine contains by volume. This is a mandatory requirement for all wines.</p>
<p>The government also intervened in 1988 and established a mandatory law declaring the quantity of sulfites that wine must contain, and all wines that have level above 10 parts per million of sulfur dioxide must clearly publish this on the label. You&rsquo;ll also notice that wine labels have a federal warning, similar to the statements you used to see on cigarettes &ndash; this warning is thanks to another 1989 federal law.</p>
<p>Remember that even though there is a minimum requirement for how much information is published on the label, the actually quantity and design will differ depending on the producer. Thankfully, the words and appearances on United States&rsquo; wine labels can be comforting and relatively easy to read.

"49";"Does the Cost of Wine Determine Quality?";"<p>Like many people, I used to think that the more I spent on a bottle of wine, the better it would be. Basically, I used to equate price to quality, and this equation is one of the largest misconceptions when it comes to wine. There is an &ldquo;aura&rdquo; surrounding expensive wine, and too many consumers believe that the quality of a wine is measured by its price. I often see consumers give me &ldquo;the face&rdquo; when I recommend to them a reasonably priced wine that has rated well. They believe, like I used to, that they should be paying more for good wine, but this is not necessarily true.</p>
<p>The price of a wine can depend on many factors, from the number of bottles produced to the location in which the grapes were grown. &nbsp;Here are a few key characteristics:</p>
<p><strong>Quantity</strong>- The quantity of wine that the vineyard produces is one factor that determines its cost. If a vineyard makes 20,000 cases of a wine, they can sell each bottle for less than a vineyard that produces only 200 cases would. The less wine a vineyard produces, the higher its prices might be. In this case, you&rsquo;re paying for rarity, not quality.</p>
<p><strong>Single Vineyard</strong>- Single Vineyard is a term used for wines that are produced from a only one vineyard, and it usually is associated with the signature style of the vineyard. Some wines are blends of different vintages or grapes from different regions which lowers their cost compared to single vineyard wines.</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong>- Sometimes, the price is influenced by coming from <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/wine-by-region"">a certain area</a> that is known for producing really good wine. For example, Napa Valley, CA, is known for exceptional wines, and its location and its reputation help Napa Valley vineyards increase their prices a little more.</p>
<p><strong>Estate Wines</strong>- Estate bottled wines are wineries that grow and produce their wine all in one location. Not to be confused with Single Vineyard, Estate bottled wines are all grown, picked, and produced in one winery, whereas Single Vineyard wines could acquire their grapes from a region outside the winery. The economics of an estate wine&rsquo;s production influence the final bottle price.</p>
<p><strong>Vintage</strong>- The vintage is the year the wine was produced. Sometimes a good climate or good weather could make for a great year or great vintage. The vintages are rated by all the major wine publications, which publish vintage charts. For example, in 2007, Napa and most of California had nearly perfect weather conditions, so that year made for a desirable vintage.</p>
<p><strong>Production Costs</strong>- Sometimes manually-picked grapes, as compared to machine-picked grapes, can factor into the cost of a wine. Some vineyards that have hills or rough terrain may need to manually pick their grapes, and so their production costs are higher.</p>
<p><strong>Wine Store</strong>- Another factor is where you buy your wine from. Some stores mark their wine up to make a certain profit. Other stores, such as a bigger wine shop, have the available space to purchase quantity-discounted wine and in turn can offer a lower price to the public.</p>
<p>These are a few of the most important factors that ultimately go into determining the price you pay for wine. Notice that these factors have a little to do with quality, but also include considerations of production, retail, and brand. The conclusion of this knowledge is that there are many lower priced wines that are equal, if not better, than high priced wines. Of course, when choosing a wine, don&rsquo;t let the price be your guide. The best way to find another quality wine is by word-of-mouth.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:38:35";"does-the-cost-of-wine-determine-quality";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Wine Price, Wine Flavor, Wines";"Does a wine's quality have any relationship to its cost?

"50";"Does Wine Vintage Matter?";"<p>When we think of the word &ldquo;vintage&rdquo; we often think of something old that is good enough in some way to keep around. Cars, clothing, and memorabilia from previous eras are &ldquo;vintage&rdquo; when we value the age they represent and the current trend has brought it back into style. In fact, their age sets them apart from their modern counterparts. We often connect the vintage with &ldquo;classic,&rdquo; and we also connect these both to &ldquo;good.&rdquo; But when it comes to wines, is vintage always good? The truth is that vintage wines can be an important quality, but not in all situations.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;vintage&rdquo; does not have the same meaning for wines and classic cars. When considering a vintaged wine, the vintage is referring to a wine produced in a particular area in a particular year. Just glance at any label and you will see a wine&rsquo;s vintage when you read its location and year of origin. Do understand, though, that certain countries allow their wines to be mixed with wines from other years &ndash; they do this to maintain a consistent taste in the wine over time.</p>
<p>To better understand the vintages of wines, you can see how your vintage is rated on a vintage chart.</p>
<h2>Vintage Charts</h2>
<p>The natural cycles of nature bring good and bad years for wines. A vintage chart helps catalog which years for which wines were good, and which were bad. The factors that contribute to the good or bad rating a vintage chart lists include climate, region, and weather. Grapes suffer from even slight alterations in their growing conditions, and these small changes can make the difference between a good wine and a bad one. Many vintage charts are available in major wine publications such as Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast, and Wine Advocate. Many wine enthusiasts refer to these charts as guides when selecting their next wine purchase.</p>
<p>Remember that a vintage chart is not a guaranteed seal of approval: just because a certain region had a great vintage year doesn&rsquo;t mean that all of the wine from that area is going to be good. The vintage chart is only a guide that provides estimates and recommendations, not guarantees. If you really want to use a vintage chart effectively, use it as a portion of your wine purchasing toolbox: consult charts, experts&rsquo; opinions, and your own experiences and preferences to find a wine that is truly pleasing to you.</p>
<p>The vintage&rsquo;s importance is debatable. Although it serves as a guide, it is possible that high quality modern farming techniques can turn a so-so year into a good one. Vintage&rsquo;s relevance also depends on the types of wines you purchase. The wines that elude the grip of the vintage chart are the wines that are not meant to age; young wines and wines with no aging potential are the exceptions to such charts. For example, Carlo Rossi table wines don&rsquo;t list a vintage because their shelf life is so short.</p>
<p>So before leaping to a vintage chart, consider what wines you plan to buy. If you are a die-hard collector or if you want to purchase a gift for a wine lover, then definitely consult these charts and consider the vintage. But if you&rsquo;re just looking for a good drink, don&rsquo;t worry too much about the vintage &ndash; just enjoy.</p>

"51";"Does Wine Cause Headaches?";"<p><strong>Sulfites</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, people complain that red wine gives them headaches. Some people suffer extreme migranes with blinding white spots after drinking a glass of wine. Some even get symptoms of nausea and flushing. Most of the myths associated with headaches from sulfites comes from the warning sticker on most wine bottles stating the wines contain sulfites. People generally see this warning and automatically believe that this is the cause of their headaches. No one knows for sure why this happens but it is not because of the sulfites. All wines contain sulfites, but what many don&rsquo;t know is that white wines, dried fruits, and even processed lunch meats contain more sulfites than red wine. In fact, only 1% of the general population is sensitive to sulfites.</p>
<p><strong>Tannins</strong></p>
<p>Some people suggest, wrongly, that tannins are the cause of headaches from wine. Tannins are flavonoids that give wine the characteristics of being dry. Red wines have more tannins than white wines. Tannins play an important role in preventing oxidation. During aging, the tannins gradually become sediment, but until then they are vital to giving a wine the ability to age. Studies show that tannins cause the release of serotonin which may possibly cause headaches but more research is needed. Chocolate, soy and teas contain tannins like wine but, curiously, people do not report having similar reactions.</p>
<p><strong>Histamines</strong></p>
<p>A study reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (Feb 2001) showed that histamines whether in low or high doses had any effect or produced any headaches in their test subjects. Only in rare cases people were affected by histamines. The solution is to take a Claritin an hour before drinking to see if you have a histamine reaction.</p>
<p><strong>Prostaglandins</strong></p>
<p>Prostaglandins can contribute to pain and swelling because some people are not able to metabolize them. A prostaglandin is a group of compounds that come from fatty acids and have an important function in the body. Similar to hormones, they act as mediators and aid in the regulating the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle tissue. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen as well as aspirin act as inhibitors and some may benefit from taking these before or after the consumption of wine.</p>
<p><strong>Remedies</strong></p>
<p>These are just a few of the causes of headaches and by experimenting with the preventive measures; you might be able to figure out what your allergic reaction is from. More studies are needed to determine the association of headaches and wine. Many customers come in to the store to try a sulfite-free wine, hoping to battle their severe headaches. Unfortunately, many of these customers come back looking for other solutions. Sulfite-free wines although say sulfite free may still contain natural sulfites and the label usually suggests that no additional sulfites have been added to the wine. In my experience, sometimes the brand of wine may be the most important factor, and it is just a matter of finding the right wine for you.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:39:32";"does-wine-cause-headaches";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Wine Safety, Health, Headaches, Wines";"You might love wine, but wine might love you back too much!

"52";"German Wine Classifications";"<p>Those of you who begin getting acquainted with the exotic words associated with wine and bottle labels often feel that familiar intimidation resurface when it comes to German wines. Every once in a while I get in the mood for a nice sweet wine or dessert wine to sip on after a nice meal, and Riesling is ideal for many of these occasions. However, just one glance as words like Spatlese or Eiswein are enough to turn away even the most adventurous palates. No wonder people often walk right past the <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/white-wine.html"">Riesling section</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, by just learning a little bit about how German wine is classified and labeled, intimidating and unfamiliar wines can become dear friends. German wine is classified into several different quality categories based on several factors including region, sweetness, and the ripeness of the grapes. This system, developed in 1971, is different from the majority of wine classification systems set up across the globe. Many producers have criticized this system for not showing a large enough difference between better and lesser quality vineyards. Worse yet, wine drinkers uncomfortable with reading German will naturally have problems understanding the information placed on labels.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand the German wine classification system is by knowing that there are two basic principles that the wine is separated into: Sweetness and Quality. The quality levels of these principles are defined into four categories.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Categories</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deutscher Tafelwein</strong>- This quality level is associated with basic table wine. The European equivalent is Vin de Table. The alcohol level must be at least 8.5% by volume. This wine is produced exclusively from allowed German-grown varieties in one of the country&rsquo;s five regions. The total acidity must reach a level of 4.5 grams/liter.</p>
<p><strong>Deutscher Landwein</strong>- This wine is also known as German country wine, equivalent to the Europeans&rsquo; Vin de Pays. This classification was introduced in 1982 and the wine must come from one of the 19 regions where the grapes must reach an alcohol level of at least 0.5% or higher. The wine must be dry or off-dry in style. These wines can also be referred to as German fruit wines.</p>
<p><strong>Qualitatswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QBA)</strong>- This wine is considered good quality and must be made of allowed varieties from 13 wine growing regions. The alcohol level must reach at least 7% by volume and the region must be shown on the label. QBAs range from semi-sweet to dry, and this information is usually located on the label.</p>
<p><strong>Pradikatswein</strong>- This was renamed in 2007 from Qualitatswein mit Pradikat (QMP). This is the top-level wine in the German classification system. These wines range from dry to intensely sweet. The wine must be produced by grapes from the allowed 13 regions with an alcohol level of at least 7% by volume.</p>
<p>By just glancing at a German wine bottle label now, you can determine the quality of wine. When you identify which of the four classifications your bottle falls into, you&rsquo;ll have a strong idea of what degree quality the wine possesses.</p>
<p>The second way to determine what the wine is like is by examining the sweetness levels indicated on the label.</p>
<p><strong>Sweetness Classifications</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kabinett</strong>- This is a fully ripe light wine that is typically semi-sweet unless otherwise stated on the label. It possesses a very crisp and clean texture.</p>
<p><strong>Spatlese</strong>- Spatlese is actually translated into &ldquo;late harvest&rdquo; and is on the sweeter side, unless designated as a full-bodied dry wine. Although Spatlese is not as dry as a dessert wine, it is fruitier and sweeter than Kabinett.</p>
<p><strong>Auslese</strong>- Auslese means &ldquo;select harvest&rdquo; and is made from very ripe bunches or grapes that sometimes have the noble rot character which makes them semi-sweet or sweet. Auslese can also come in a very powerful dry wine if designated as such, and can be considered a dessert wine. This classification can cover an extensive quantity and range of wines.</p>
<p><strong>Beerenauslese</strong>- This is translated in to &ldquo;select berry harvest&rdquo; (SBH) and is made from individually selected grapes affected by noble rot, which makes for a rich and sweet dessert wine.</p>
<p><strong>Eiswein</strong>- Also considered an Ice wine, this is made from grapes that have been naturally frozen, making a very concentrated wine. This classification is required to have the same level of sugar as a Beerenauslese. Until 1980, Eisweins used grapes that were affected by noble rot.</p>
<p><strong>Trockenbeerebauslese</strong>- Trockenbeerebauslese is translated into &ldquo;select dry berry harvest.&rdquo; This wine is made from overripe shriveled grapes often affected by noble rot, making them extremely sweet and rich.</p>
<p><strong>Symbols and other descriptive words</strong></p>
<p>German wines have very information labels, providing lots of information that other countries&rsquo; wines do not. In fact, there are names for just about everything on the labels, and unlocking the language is the key to discovering what each bottle contains. There is even wording for the color of the wine. For exampale, Weinwein is the word for white wine, Rotwein is Red wine, Rosewein is Rose wine. Weinherbst is rose or a blanc de noir, made from the pinot noir grape. Weinherbst must be made from Pradikatswein, or QBA. There are no restrictions on the color, and the wine ranges from dry to sweet.</p>
<p>Beyond wording, sometimes the label&rsquo;s design tells you what you need to know about a German wine. You might find a gold foil on the bottle which indicates that the producer considers it better-than-average. Stars indicate that a Pradikatswein has been harvested at a higher level of ripeness than minimum requirements allow. Stars also indicates that the wine will be sweeter.</p>
<p>Fuder (vat) numbers usually indicate a better wine and often the numbers added to the label are arranged in order. Most wines in the Mosel region usually label their semi-sweet and sweet wines with numbers.</p>
<p>German wine classifications can get a little more detailed with wines from special regions. These wines include Liebfraumilch, Moseltaler, Riesling Hochgewachs, Rotling, Schillerwein, and Badisch Rotgold.</p>
<p><strong>Dry Wine Classifications</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to dry wines, there are three official classifications that you&rsquo;ll see on wines bottled after 2000. There are also a few unofficial labels that you may observe:</p>
<p><strong>Classic</strong>&nbsp;is dry or off-dry and conforms to higher standards. This wine is food-friendly and made from varietals from regions considered classical.</p>
<p><strong>Selection</strong>&nbsp;is a wine that is a Spatlese trocken from a selected site.</p>
<p><strong>Erstes Gewachs </strong>is&nbsp;used only in Rheingau for top level dry wines from selected sites.</p>
<p><strong>Grosses Gewachs&nbsp;</strong>is&nbsp;a designation used by VDP members. This wine is designated as a top-level dry wine from a selected sites used by the Bernkasteler Ring.</p>
<p><strong>Erste Lage </strong>is&nbsp;a designation used to denote selected sites suitable for Erstes Gewachs and Grosses wines. Also used by VDP in Mosel to design top level wines from selected sites.</p>
<p>Yes, it certainly does get a little complicated with all the different names and labeling, and considering that it&rsquo;s all in German, one can definitely say that it takes time and practice to develop a comfort with accessing German wine labels. But if you know the four levels of sweetness and the four levels of quality, then you should be able to determine what wine is suitable for your tastes.</p>
<p>German wine labels are pretty easy to understand once you known the language and words used to describe the wine. Every label should have the vintage, the winery, the varietal, the ripeness, the vineyard, region, and government approved number or an AP#. The VDP used in the above descriptions stands for an elite group of winemaking estates in Germany which label which wines are approved with their logo of an eagle with the VDP above it. Now that you&rsquo;re armed with this information, it&rsquo;s time to go out, find a German bottle, and enjoy!</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:40:12";"german-wine-classifications";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"German Wines, Wine Classification, Wine, Riesling";"Learn more about the differences between all the kinds of German wines at City Wine Cellar University.";"0";"German Wine, Riesling";"<p>Those of you who begin getting acquainted with the exotic words associated with wine and bottle labels often feel that familiar intimidation resurface when it comes to German wines. Every once in a while I get in the mood for a nice sweet wine or dessert wine to sip on after a nice meal, and Riesling is ideal for many of these occasions. However, just one glance as words like Spatlese or Eiswein are enough to turn away even the most adventurous palates. No wonder people often walk right past the Riesling section.</p>
<p>Fortunately, by just learning a little bit about how German wine is classified and labeled, intimidating and unfamiliar wines can become dear friends. German wine is classified into several different quality categories based on several factors including region, sweetness, and the ripeness of the grapes. This system, developed in 1971, is different from the majority of wine classification systems set up across the globe. Many producers have criticized this system for not showing a large enough difference between better and lesser quality vineyards. Worse yet, wine drinkers uncomfortable with reading German will naturally have problems understanding the information placed on labels.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand the German wine classification system is by knowing that there are two basic principles that the wine is separated into: Sweetness and Quality. The quality levels of these principles are defined into four categories.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Categories</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deutscher Tafelwein</strong>- This quality level is associated with basic table wine. The European equivalent is Vin de Table. The alcohol level must be at least 8.5% by volume. This wine is produced exclusively from allowed German-grown varieties in one of the country&rsquo;s five regions. The total acidity must reach a level of 4.5 grams/liter.</p>
<p><strong>Deutscher Landwein</strong>- This wine is also known as German country wine, equivalent to the Europeans&rsquo; Vin de Pays. This classification was introduced in 1982 and the wine must come from one of the 19 regions where the grapes must reach an alcohol level of at least 0.5% or higher. The wine must be dry or off-dry in style. These wines can also be referred to as German fruit wines.</p>
<p><strong>Qualitatswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QBA)</strong>- This wine is considered good quality and must be made of allowed varieties from 13 wine growing regions. The alcohol level must reach at least 7% by volume and the region must be shown on the label. QBAs range from semi-sweet to dry, and this information is usually located on the label.</p>
<p><strong>Pradikatswein</strong>- This was renamed in 2007 from Qualitatswein mit Pradikat (QMP). This is the top-level wine in the German classification system. These wines range from dry to intensely sweet. The wine must be produced by grapes from the allowed 13 regions with an alcohol level of at least 7% by volume.</p>
<p>By just glancing at a German wine bottle label now, you can determine the quality of wine. When you identify which of the four classifications your bottle falls into, you&rsquo;ll have a strong idea of what degree quality the wine possesses.</p>
<p>The second way to determine what the wine is like is by examining the sweetness levels indicated on the label.</p>
<p><strong>Sweetness Classifications</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kabinett</strong>- This is a fully ripe light wine that is typically semi-sweet unless otherwise stated on the label. It possesses a very crisp and clean texture.</p>
<p><strong>Spatlese</strong>- Spatlese is actually translated into &ldquo;late harvest&rdquo; and is on the sweeter side, unless designated as a full-bodied dry wine. Although Spatlese is not as dry as a dessert wine, it is fruitier and sweeter than Kabinett.</p>
<p><strong>Auslese</strong>- Auslese means &ldquo;select harvest&rdquo; and is made from very ripe bunches or grapes that sometimes have the noble rot character which makes them semi-sweet or sweet. Auslese can also come in a very powerful dry wine if designated as such, and can be considered a dessert wine. This classification can cover an extensive quantity and range of wines.</p>
<p><strong>Beerenauslese</strong>- This is translated in to &ldquo;select berry harvest&rdquo; (SBH) and is made from individually selected grapes affected by noble rot, which makes for a rich and sweet dessert wine.</p>
<p><strong>Eiswein</strong>- Also considered an Ice wine, this is made from grapes that have been naturally frozen, making a very concentrated wine. This classification is required to have the same level of sugar as a Beerenauslese. Until 1980, Eisweins used grapes that were affected by noble rot.</p>
<p><strong>Trockenbeerebauslese</strong>- Trockenbeerebauslese is translated into &ldquo;select dry berry harvest.&rdquo; This wine is made from overripe shriveled grapes often affected by noble rot, making them extremely sweet and rich.</p>
<p><strong>Symbols and other descriptive words</strong></p>
<p>German wines have very information labels, providing lots of information that other countries&rsquo; wines do not. In fact, there are names for just about everything on the labels, and unlocking the language is the key to discovering what each bottle contains. There is even wording for the color of the wine. For exampale, Weinwein is the word for white wine, Rotwein is Red wine, Rosewein is Rose wine. Weinherbst is rose or a blanc de noir, made from the pinot noir grape. Weinherbst must be made from Pradikatswein, or QBA. There are no restrictions on the color, and the wine ranges from dry to sweet.</p>
<p>Beyond wording, sometimes the label&rsquo;s design tells you what you need to know about a German wine. You might find a gold foil on the bottle which indicates that the producer considers it better-than-average. Stars indicate that a Pradikatswein has been harvested at a higher level of ripeness than minimum requirements allow. Stars also indicates that the wine will be sweeter.</p>
<p>Fuder (vat) numbers usually indicate a better wine and often the numbers added to the label are arranged in order. Most wines in the Mosel region usually label their semi-sweet and sweet wines with numbers.</p>
<p>German wine classifications can get a little more detailed with wines from special regions. These wines include Liebfraumilch, Moseltaler, Riesling Hochgewachs, Rotling, Schillerwein, and Badisch Rotgold.</p>
<p><strong>Dry Wine Classifications</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to dry wines, there are three official classifications that you&rsquo;ll see on wines bottled after 2000. There are also a few unofficial labels that you may observe:</p>
<p><strong>Classic</strong>&nbsp;is dry or off-dry and conforms to higher standards. This wine is food-friendly and made from varietals from regions considered classical.</p>
<p><strong>Selection</strong>&nbsp;is a wine that is a Spatlese trocken from a selected site.</p>
<p><strong>Erstes Gewachs </strong>is&nbsp;used only in Rheingau for top level dry wines from selected sites.</p>
<p><strong>Grosses Gewachs&nbsp;</strong>is&nbsp;a designation used by VDP members. This wine is designated as a top-level dry wine from a selected sites used by the Bernkasteler Ring.</p>
<p><strong>Erste Lage </strong>is&nbsp;a designation used to denote selected sites suitable for Erstes Gewachs and Grosses wines. Also used by VDP in Mosel to design top level wines from selected sites.</p>
<p>Yes, it certainly does get a little complicated with all the different names and labeling, and considering that it&rsquo;s all in German, one can definitely say that it takes time and practice to develop a comfort with accessing German wine labels.

"54";"Deciphering Wine Labels";"<p>When faced with the task of picking out a bottle of wine, we rely on wine labels to tell us what the content is and will hopefully give us some hints on its quality. Understanding what wine labels need to show and what they mean can help us to decipher the content inside and make the selection clearer.</p>
<p>Information shown on a wine&rsquo;s label is strictly governed by regulations. All wines produced within the EU follow the same labeling guidelines based on regulations differentiating a Quality Wine from a Table Wine, and information required for each category. New World regulations are less strict, and much of the success of New World wines has been attributed to wine makers&rsquo; greater freedom in communicating creatively with consumers. Labeling guidelines in the Old World are strictly regulated according to appellation rules sometimes to the extent of restricting the size and the type of font used.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the key information shown on a wine label:</p>
<p><strong>Wine Designation</strong><br />Within the EU, a wine must be designated as either a QWPSR (Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions) or a Table Wine. For wines made outside of the EU, they must indicate the word &ldquo;wine&rdquo; when sold within the EU. In the United States, there is no designation requirement on wine label.</p>
<p><strong>Geographical Reference</strong><br />In the EU, geographical reference for Quality Wine is indicated by the name of controlled appellation (for example, names of AOC/AC/VDQS in France, DOC/DOCG in Italy, QmP/QbA in Germany, DO/DOC in Spain, DOC in Portugal). Labels for Table Wine must simply indicate the name of the producing country. There are intermediate categories such as France&rsquo;s Vin de Pays, Italy&rsquo;s IGT or Germany&rsquo;s Landewein that allow the name of a broader region to be specified. Within the EU, if a geographical region is stated, 100% of wine must come from the specified region.</p>
<p>For the New World, geographical reference can take the form of country name, or the name of a state or region. In the United States, there is a movement to establish controlled zones called AVA (American Viticultural Area) similar to the controlled appellation&nbsp;system in Europe. If an AVA is listed, 85% of grapes must come within the AVA. Otherwise, only 75% is required. In Australia and South Africa, 85% of the grapes are required to come from the region specified on the label.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Reference</strong><br />Reserva, Gran Reserva, Riserva, and Reserve are regulated terms within EU. They are used with the intention of distinguishing superior wines and often carry a minimum ageing requirement and a higher alcohol level. For example, in Portugal, a Reserva wine comes from a superior vintage and must contain at least 0.5% more alcohol than the regional minimum. In Spain, Reserva and Gran Reserva carry minimum ageing requirements. A Spanish red Reserva wine must be aged for at least 3 years before release of which 1 year must be spent in oak. In New World countries, these terms do not carry any regulatory requirements and are often applied loosely.</p>
<p><strong>Volume</strong><br />It is required to state the volume of wine contained inside a bottle with the most common being 750mL plus an &ldquo;e&rdquo; mark.</p>
<p><strong>Alcoholic Strength</strong><br />This is simply an indication of how much alcohol is contained in a bottled wine. An ABV measurement expressed as a percentage of total volume (% by vol) is the standard used.</p>
<p><strong>Vintage</strong><br />A vintage cannot be stated for a Table Wine with the EU. It may only be shown for a Quality Wine. If a vintage is shown, the wine must comprise 100% of the vintage indicated. In the United States, Chile, Argentina, Australia, and South Africa, 85% minimum must come from the vintage stated.</p>
<p><strong>Name of Producer/Bottler</strong><br />This is simply an indication of who made or bottled the wine. Although in the EU, a producer&rsquo;s address that includes the same name as that of a controlled appellation cannot be used on a Table Wine&rsquo;s label. In this case, address information is substituted by a postal code. It is of particular importance in certain regions such as Bordeaux and Alsace as appellation rules require bottling must be done within the appellation. In France, terms such as mis en bouteille au ch&acirc;teau or mis au domaine are shown on label to indicate compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Lot Marking</strong><br />It is a requirement under EU regulations to show a lot number associated to a wine&rsquo;s bottling batch in case of any consumer&rsquo;s complaint or recall. The mark is typically shown starting with an L then a coded bottling date.</p>
<p><strong>Sulphites &amp; Other Allergens</strong><br />In most countries, it is a requirement to indicate that a wine contains sulphites if it contains more than 10 mg/L of sulphur dioxide. EU regulation changes have taken effect since 2004 and the same rule pertaining to sulphites also applies to any wine made or sold within the EU. Since 2002, Australia and New Zealand require other allergens such as fish, milk, nuts or egg products used in processing aid to be listed. Starting June 30, 2012, EU members will also be required to disclose usage of casein (milk products) and ovalbumin (egg products) during a wine&rsquo;s production.</p>
<p><strong>Government Warning</strong><br />In the United States, the government requires all wines to carry a health warning from the Surgeon General to pregnant women, car drivers and operators of heavy machinery against the consumption of alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>Varietal Information</strong><br />Varietal information is optional but is found to be behind much of New World&rsquo;s marketing success. Many controlled appellations prohibit the use of varietal names on front labels. Some progressive producers have taken the route to communicate the varietal information on the optional back label. In the EU, if a variety is specified on a label, the wine must be made from at least 85% of the variety. There are more stringent laws according to the regulations of each controlled appellation. In the United States, the minimum varies according to each state. In Oregon, the requirement is 95%, in Washington it is 85%, and in most of the other states it is 75%.</p>
<p><strong>Organic and Biodynamic Labeling</strong><br />Studies by the International Organic Accreditation Service, Letis, indicate that organic wine consumption maintains its growth margin despite the recent economic downtown. The United States and Canada both register a high growth rate of 20% annually. Most countries in Europe register an increase between 5% to 15% annually (Sweden 18%, Holland 10%, Denmark 8%, Italy &amp; Switzerland 7%, France &amp; Austria 5%). The terms organic and biodynamic are not regulated by wine laws. Each country has her own governing bodies on organic products. In France, wine producers may seek organic certification through Ecocert, Qualit&eacute; France, ULSAE, Agrocert, Certipaq and ACLAVE. In the United States, organic certification is handled by the USDA. Currently, biodynamic producers are certified through Demeter.</p>
<p><strong>Other Optional Information</strong><br />Information about a winery&rsquo;s history, winemaking philosophy and vineyard characteristics are helpful in strengthening a brand&rsquo;s prestige. With plenty of competitions on the market, many labels also include information on style, sweetness level, serving temperature, anticipated maturity window, and food pairing ideas to help consumers make purchasing choices. Many producers also choose to include technical aspects such as vintage &amp; harvest data, yield, production method, method &amp; length of aging, annual production, or even residual sugar and acidity levels.</p>
<p>On the business front, often the name of importer/distributor will be found on a label, alongside contact information (with a website address and QR code to encourage inquiry). An element that is considered beneficial by many is to show competition awards or scores from major critics and publications. Awards and medals are commonly to be printed on the label appear as stickers affixed to the bottles.</p>";"1";"2013-07-17 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:42:30";"deciphering-wine-labels";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Wine Labels, Reading Wines";"What's the deal with wine labels, and why are they so complicated?

"55";"Why Are Decanters Important?";"<p>Much of what many people suppose is purely ceremonial or symbolic about wine drinking and wine culture often has purely practical and logical reasoning behind it. A good example would be regarding the fact that the shape of the glasses from which we drink wines. This is due to far more than simple tradition-based posturing. Such things have come about through centuries of innovation, trial and error, and inspirational ideas which attempt to enhance the flavors and aromas of wine, and thus increase our enjoyment of these wonderfully varied and interesting drinks. Visit any good wine bar, cellar or restaurant, and it is highly likely that you will see your chosen wine decanted before you drink it. This is often undertaken with a certain sense of ceremony, and as such, has often been dismissed by the uninitiated as little more than an unnecessary moment of theatricality. But why exactly is the decanting process so important, and why has it remained more or less unchanged over the centuries?</p>
<p><strong>History of Decanters</strong></p>
<p>The pouring of wines into a crystal or glass decanter certainly adds a sense of style and class to any table, but this is merely one small aspect of the idea behind the process. It is widely agreed that it was those first great vintners &ndash; the Romans &ndash; who developed the early glass decanters. Indeed, glassblowing was a common practice in and around the Roman empire, and we can see some beautiful and impressive examples of surviving Roman glassware in various museums and archaeological sites around the world. For the Romans, wines were something deeply important, and even though they were drunk by almost everybody, everyday around the empire, efforts were consistently made to improve the drink. Wines were flavored with honey, spices, even seawater, they were the first to experiment with ageing wines in barrels. It should come as no surprise, therefore, to find that the Romans were the first to develop items designed to improve the wine-drinking experience, among which we must list the glass decanter.</p>
<p><strong>Removing Sediments</strong></p>
<p>The most basic reason why wines should be decanted is in order to deal with the potential sediments the liquid might carry. Sediments occur&nbsp;naturally in wines, and it is inevitable that a drink made from pressed fruit should contain some. Although most of the sediment will remain in the bottle as a wine is decanted, the flared shape of a classic decanter also helps to remove the sediment as it is tipped to fill a glass. This results in making the wine within the glass clearer in both texture and flavor: exactly as the winery intended it to be drunk.</p>
<p><strong>Let it Breathe</strong></p>
<p>The other key reason for decanting wine is to allow the wine to &lsquo;breathe&rsquo; or aerate. This process is an especially important one for younger, un-aged wines, which require twenty minutes or so to mellow in the air in order for the best features of their flavor and aroma to come through and be enjoyed. Whilst this is commonly done in households by removing the cork, and leaving the wine to one side for some time, with the help of a decanter, the process comes about more fully and with far more satisfying results. The decanting process with older, aged wine, however, is quite different. Because they are likely to hold a considerably higher level of sediment, they must be decanted very slowly as to leave the sediment in the bottle, and the tip of the bottle should be in contact with the lip of the decanter while it is being poured. This prevents the wine from becoming aerated during the decanting process, which can rob it of many of its important and prized features. For much the same reason, a stopper should be placed on top of the decanter when drinking aged wines, and removed only when serving, and the wine should certainly not be left to breathe in the same way as a younger wine would.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Sensory Enjoyment</strong></p>
<p>Of course, there is one final reason why decanters are used, and this is the same reason why they are made from transparent material like glass or crystal. A decanter allows you and your guests to admire the wine, to enjoy it visually and not merely with your nose or palate. Wines are often beautiful things, bearing delightful colors and refracting light in attractive ways. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you want to keep it in a vessel which shows off some of its finest features?</p>";"1";"2013-07-17 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:43:21";"why-are-decanters-important";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Red Wine, Sediment, Aeration, Decanters";"Wine served from a decanter always looks better, but can the container improve your enjoyment in other ways?

But why exactly is the decanting process so important, and why has it remained more or less unchanged over the centuries?</p>
<p><strong>History of Decanters</strong></p>
<p>The pouring of wines into a crystal or glass decanter certainly adds a sense of style and class to any table, but this is merely one small aspect of the idea behind the process. It is widely agreed that it was those first great vintners &ndash; the Romans &ndash; who developed the early glass decanters. Indeed, glassblowing was a common practice in and around the Roman empire, and we can see some beautiful and impressive examples of surviving Roman glassware in various museums and archaeological sites around the world. For the Romans, wines were something deeply important, and even though they were drunk by almost everybody, everyday around the empire, efforts were consistently made to improve the drink. Wines were flavored with honey, spices, even seawater, they were the first to experiment with ageing wines in barrels. It should come as no surprise, therefore, to find that the Romans were the first to develop items designed to improve the wine-drinking experience, among which we must list the glass decanter.</p>
<p><strong>Removing Sediments</strong></p>
<p>The most basic reason why wines should be decanted is in order to deal with the potential sediments the liquid might carry. Sediments occur&nbsp;naturally in wines, and it is inevitable that a drink made from pressed fruit should contain some. Although most of the sediment will remain in the bottle as a wine is decanted, the flared shape of a classic decanter also helps to remove the sediment as it is tipped to fill a glass. This results in making the wine within the glass clearer in both texture and flavor: exactly as the winery intended it to be drunk.</p>
<p><strong>Let it Breathe</strong></p>
<p>The other key reason for decanting wine is to allow the wine to &lsquo;breathe&rsquo; or aerate. This process is an especially important one for younger, un-aged wines, which require twenty minutes or so to mellow in the air in order for the best features of their flavor and aroma to come through and be enjoyed. Whilst this is commonly done in households by removing the cork, and leaving the wine to one side for some time, with the help of a decanter, the process comes about more fully and with far more satisfying results. The decanting process with older, aged wine, however, is quite different. Because they are likely to hold a considerably higher level of sediment, they must be decanted very slowly as to leave the sediment in the bottle, and the tip of the bottle should be in contact with the lip of the decanter while it is being poured. This prevents the wine from becoming aerated during the decanting process, which can rob it of many of its important and prized features. For much the same reason, a stopper should be placed on top of the decanter when drinking aged wines, and removed only when serving, and the wine should certainly not be left to breathe in the same way as a younger wine would.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Sensory Enjoyment</strong></p>
<p>Of course, there is one final reason why decanters are used, and this is the same reason why they are made from transparent material like glass or crystal. A decanter allows you and your guests to admire the wine, to enjoy it visually and not merely with your nose or palate. Wines are often beautiful things, bearing delightful colors and refracting light in attractive ways. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you want to keep it in a vessel which shows off some of its finest features?</p>"
"56";"Diabetes and Wine";"<p>Diabetes is known as the &ldquo;American disease,&rdquo; and recent studies indicate that at least 6% of our population is diabetic. As our habits and diets continue to increase our susceptibility for diabetes, we are forced to confront the claim that wine and diabetes don&rsquo;t mix. The truth is that, just like any other element of a diabetic&rsquo;s diet, wine can be enjoyed if drunk in opposition.</p>
<p>The American Diabetes Association supports the fact that certain wines can in fact become a part of a diabetic&rsquo;s diet. Even though wines have sugars, different wines feature different quantities and different types. The most recommended wine for diabetics is a dry wine, as it would contain less residual sugar. If one drinks this moderately, if one has a controlled diet, and if one also follows the ADA recommendation that any drinking be accompanied with eating, then consuming wine does not pose any significant risk to a diabetic.</p>
<p>Studies even suggest that while not posing any risks, drinking a dry wine offers several health benefits: low cholesterol and improved cardiac health accompany moderate wine drinking. So yes, a diabetic can enjoy a pleasant dry glass of wine from time to time without worrying about compromising health.</p>
<p>However, if you are a diabetic and are ready to uncork that next bottle, make sure that you&rsquo;re well aware of the risks associated with diabetes, and with wine, too. Wine has the ability to prevent your liver from making sugars, which means that you might experience dangerously low blood sugar levels while drinking. If you eat while indulging in a glass of wine, you are less likely to experience this effect. Also, the symptoms of drinking too much and suffering from hypoglycemia are similar, so when you&rsquo;re drinking it may be difficult to tell the difference between which one you are experiencing. You might even have both alcohol and hypoglycemia making you sleepy, dizzy, and disoriented. Caution is key, so before you pop that next cork, make sure you speak with your physician.</p>";"1";"2013-07-18 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:41:24";"diabetes-and-wine";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Wine, Health, Diabetes";"Can wine help with diabetes?

"57";"Can Wine Be Aged?";"<p><strong>Can I age this wine, and if so, for how long?</strong></p>
<p>There are countless techniques for improving the taste, aroma and general character of wines. Vintners and wine producers have always searched for bold new methods and original ideas with which to achieve perfection in wine. From adding aromatic herbs and spices, to blending the liquid with seawater and honey, those who make wine have stopped at nothing on their quest for the perfect drink. Even today, several thousand years after wines were first produced, wineries all over the world continue to strive towards perfection &ndash; a delicate balance of tannins and acidity, of alcohol content and sweetness or astringency &ndash; and they are unlikely to stop.</p>
<p><strong>The Ageing Process</strong></p>
<p>One of the most commonly used methods for producing excellent wines of superb character is the aging process. By leaving wines to mature and age in vessels, the often harsh natural tannins present in the skins of grapes used for wine production begin to soften. As this process takes place, other characteristics of the grape are able to come through in the wine more strongly or more significantly. Aged wines are thus very different from their younger counterparts, even if the same grape varietals have been used. Aged wines are usually described as being more &lsquo;mellow&rsquo; &ndash; usually referring to the softer tannins and more balanced acids in the wine, or more &lsquo;complex&rsquo;. The complexity of an aged wine often refers to the number of different flavours and aromas present in the wine &ndash; something which is usually overshadowed in younger wines by the strength of the tannins and acids. By aging wines, a wide bouquet of aromas is gradually released by the grapes, and subtler, often quite unusual flavors are allowed to come forward and shine, resulting in more interesting and unique vintages.</p>
<p><strong>Roman Experimentation</strong></p>
<p>Wine aging has been going on for centuries &ndash; indeed, it is believed that the Romans were the first to experiment with aged wines, using clay and wooden vessels to store their copious amounts of wine and improve their flavor. Today, aging is a mark of excellence, with many of the world&rsquo;s finest wine regions having strict regulations and laws governing just how long a particular wine is allowed to be aged for in order for it to be of a quality high enough to represent a region. For example, Chianti Classico Riserva must be aged in oak for a minimum of two years, and a further three months within the bottle before being released, in order to ensure that the wine within is complex, balanced and smooth enough to deserve having such an esteemed and famous label.</p>
<p><strong>Aging In The Bottle</strong></p>
<p>Of course, the other side of ageing takes place not in the winery or wine cave, but at a home or in a wine cellar. For those who adore fine wines, home aging is a key component for ensuring their wine collection is at an optimum quality when they come to open and enjoy the bottle. But can all wines be aged at home? And which wines require the most aging?</p>
<p><strong>Aging Red Wines</strong></p>
<p>Because aging generally concerns the mellowing of tannins, white wines do not age as well as <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/red-wine.html"">red wines</a>. Because white wines most commonly contain very low tannin contents (due to the fact that the skins of white and green grapes contain few tannins), they usually need to be drunk within two or three years of the vintage date on their bottle. Red wine, on the other hand, is a whole different matter, and often red wines can be kept in a cellar or properly stored for a remarkable amount of time before reaching their optimum flavor potential.</p>
<p>Cabernet Sauvignon, being a grape varietal with thick skins and a high tannin content, has a natural affinity for oak which makes it a favorite for wineries looking to produce superb aged wines. Cabernet Sauvignon wines age extremely well in the bottle, and a fine bottle made with this grape varietal can be aged at home for between ten to fifteen years, consistently improving, mellowing and rounding. Most of the fine Bordeaux blended red wines (often regarded as the best in the world) usually contain a high percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon, and as such, it is not uncommon to find these wines gathering dust in famous wine cellars, waiting patiently to be enjoyed.</p>
<p>Other red wines made from different grape varietals also age well, although unless the grapes used to produce them are as astringent and tannin-heavy as Cabernet Sauvignon, they needn&rsquo;t be aged for quite so long. Pinot Noir reaches optimum excellence between five and ten years, as does Zinfandel. Merlots generally don&rsquo;t require more than five years, and wines made from Italian grapes such as Sangiovese and Barbera require about the same, due to their relatively light body and big, juicy flavours which burst through the tannins almost as soon as they are bottled.</p>";"1";"2013-07-17 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:44:10";"can-wine-be-aged";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Wine Aging, Red Wines, White Wine, Wines";"CWC University teaches you strategies behind wine aging, ideal wine aging, and why one might age one's wine.";"0";"Wine, Wine Aging, Cabernet Sauvignon";"<p><strong>Can I age this wine, and if so, for how long?</strong></p>

"58";"Australian Wines";"<p>When most people think of Australia, they think of kangaroos and boomerangs. What they hardly ever think about is wine; but the truth is that Australia is actually the fourth-largest exporter of wine in the world, and winemaking contributes $5.5 billion annually to the nation&rsquo;s economy. Australian wine is most widely consumed in the south Asian wine markets and the nation&rsquo;s major varietals include Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Semillon, Pinot Noir, Riesling and Sauvignon Blanc.</p>
<p>The history of Australian wine begins over two centuries ago, in 1788, when vine cuttings arrived from the Cape of Good Hope. Although the wine from these cuttings met with mixed success, the settlers did manage to cultivate suitable wine-making vines. Thirty years later, in 1820, wine began to be sold locally, and in 1822 an entrepreneur by the name of Gregory Blaxland began exporting Australian wine. He even won an overseas aware for his exports.</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s climate and terroir presented unique challenges to potential wine producers. After experimentation, mixed success with cultivation, and plenty of failed attempts, Australia finally made its big impression on the world stage in 1873 when French wine judges &ndash; the most renowned judges in the world &ndash; thoroughly enjoyed the Australian product. At least, until they discovered where it originated. Australian wines continued to earn high honors in French competitions for many years.</p>
<p>As recently as the 1970s, Australia produced many sweet and fortified wines. Since then, Australia has rapidly grown into a wine producing leader in both quantity and quality. Over the last twenty years, Australia has suffered from low grape prices, which has resulted in the government urging producers to pull their wines. One result of this move was the introduction of clean skin wines. Organic and biodynamic farming have been popular methods in Australian wine production, and the demand for this sort of organically produced wine has grown in European markets.</p>
<p>Part of what has contributed to Australia&rsquo;s success with wine is how strictly it is regulated. Like other countries, Australia&rsquo;s wine regions are regulated &ndash; as reflected on their labels &ndash; and are divided into South Eastern Australia, Victoria wine region, New South Wales wine region, and the Western Australia wine region. Australian winemaking results have been impressive and have established benchmarks for a number of varietals.</p>
<p>One of the most famous Australian wines is called Penfolds Grange. This impressive wine has won more than 50 gold medals around the globe and has topped the major charts and reviews in publications worldwide. Some of the more popular names you may or may not have heard of are Peter Lehman, Yellow Tail, Little Penguin, Molly Dooker, and Greg Norman. Some rather impressive and inexpensive wines have come from Australia, and I am sure you will enjoy many of the wines they produce.

"59";"Biodynamic wines";"<p><strong>Biodynamic wines &ndash; the latest phase of the organic revolution?</strong></p>
<p>All over the world, a change is happening in how people are choose their consumer products and spend their money. Mass production has fallen greatly out of favor among the discerning public, and small, independent companies doing things in their own way and to their own principles have become increasingly more successful and prominent in the market. Part of this change in the attitudes of both producers and consumers has been due to the rise in demand and popularity of organic produce, items which have a strong connection to the region in which they are produced, and items certified to carry as little chemical content as possible, or none whatsoever. We have seen this have a huge effect on way the food is produced, manufactured and purchased, and it was only a matter of time before such principles began to effect the world of wine.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise of Biodynamic Farming</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the more niche and extreme end of this issue has been evident in the rise of biodynamic wines, those which have been made from vines grown to the strict biodynamic principles of organic farming laid down by Rudolph Steiner in 1924. Such principles involve the use of cow manure, powdered quartz and several preparations made from medicinal plants. Steiner&rsquo;s belief was that by working with fruits and vegetables (including grapes) using his methods, and by aligning one&rsquo;s farming practices with the changes in the moon, one could greatly increase both the yield and the quality of your harvest. However, the biodynamic principles go considerably further when it comes to wine production, and biodynamic wineries often do all that they can to ensure their vineyards are moving with what Steiner referred to as the earth&rsquo;s &lsquo;natural rhythms&rsquo; &ndash; the changing of the tides, the regeneration of soil, the way moisture is pulled from the earth and released by the vines into the air. Indeed, even many high end wineries in established appellations of France, Germany, Austria and elsewhere are now plowing their fields with horses, scattering crystals on their soil, and rearranging their barrels to benefit from the moon&rsquo;s gravitational pull in order to reap the supposed benefits of biodynamic wine production.</p>
<p><strong>Positive Results</strong></p>
<p>It is probable that many wineries began experimenting with biodynamics as a way of assuring their customers they had the interests of the environment in mind, such were the concerns and interests of a particular (and wealthy) demographic of the wine buying market. However, as the initial results were surprisingly very positive indeed (with not only sales of such wines being much higher than anticipated, but the reviews and general feedback also) the past few years have seen more and more wineries turning to biodynamics to improve their chances in the highly competitive wine market. Interestingly, most wineries would now claim their choice to convert to biodynamics was based on the quality of their produce alone, and less to do with the selling appeal of the biodynamic label they could put on their bottles.</p>
<p><strong>Tasting Biodynamic Wine</strong></p>
<p>What is biodynamic wine like? Does it have any distinguishing features that make it worth paying extra for? In recent years, many Michelin-starred chefs in both the United Kingdom and France have insisted on stocking only biodynamic and organic wines in their cellars, based on the belief that they couple far more successfully with organic foods. Such opinions are hard to ignore, and if biodynamic wines are good enough for Paris, perhaps it is high time the rest of us paid more attention to them. The general consensus seems to be that biodynamic wines are much the same as other organic or natural wines, containing slightly more sediment than usual and holding a more mellow, sappy character than might be expected.</p>
<p>One of the most regular statements made by wine experts regarding biodynamic wines is that they hold more of the <em>terroir</em> in their flavors &ndash; that is, that the characteristics of the soil and land they are grown in come across in the taste and the aroma of the wines. This would certainly chime with the initial theories put forward by Steiner in the 1920&prime;s, and is enough for fans of biodynamic farming to claim its superiority. However, the statement is in itself deliberately broad and open to interpretation, and such subtleties of flavour (if they exist at all) are highly likely to not be picked up by the general wine drinking public. All of this aside, though, if biodynamics helps farmers and wine producers attain quality produce without resorting to the overuse of chemicals and a disconnection from the land they work with, it is surely a step in the right direction.

"60";"Sulphur Dioxide in Winemaking";"<p><strong>What are the benefits and risks with the use of sulphur dioxide in winemaking?</strong></p>
<p>Sulphur dioxide is one of the most common additives used in winemaking. Although it is toxic at a high dosage, its controlled use offers many benefits. In particular, its antiseptic and anti-oxidative qualities ensure wines remain stable and safe until opening. Since 1987 in the US and 2005 in the EU, there have been regulations in place requiring that a wine made with sulphur dioxide carries a warning label saying it contains sulphites.</p>
<p>Despite its usefulness, sulphur dioxide can also be risky to use. During the winemaking process, protecting a wine from oxidation and spoilage is crucial. After fermentation, racking is a common first step to clarify the wine. During this process, any movement may lead to oxygen intake. Sulphur dioxide works as a protective measure to treat the equipment used during racking.</p>
<p>Barrels, used during aging process, are commonly treated with sulphur dioxide due to the risk of allowing oxygen exchange. It is also crucial to treat used barrels due to their higher risk of bacteria contamination. Right before bottling, it is common to treat bottles with sulphur dioxide to flush out any oxygen and bacteria. Finally, a controlled amount is added at bottling but its level is regulated by the EU according to wine type and sweetness level.</p>
<p>When used in a sufficient dosage, sulphur dioxide is an effective antioxidant as it combines with any free oxygen to form sulphuric acid, thus removing the risk of oxidation. It also kills enzymes (called oxidases) that promote oxidation. It is especially important for a white wine to be treated with sulphur dioxide to prevent the ill-effects of oxidation such as browning and off-aromas. If sign of minor oxidation is present, a correct dosage of sulphur dioxide can bind with acetaldehyde, which is the main product of oxidation, to remove any aroma of oxidation and to freshen the wine.</p>
<p>Acting as an antiseptic, sulphur dioxide kills any bacteria that could cause spoilage. Acetabacter, a common bacteria affecting wine, is the culprit turning wine into vinegar. Sulphur dioxide is effective in that it kills both the bacteria and removes any oxygen that the bacteria relies on to survive. It also kills any yeast that may remain inside a bottled wine, especially critical in the presence of residual sugar, to prevent re-fermentation in the bottle. Without sufficient amount of sulphur dioxide added, a wine runs the risk of spoilage, oxidation, browning, presence of off-aromas, and re-fermentation in the bottle.</p>
<p>The addition of sulphur dioxide must be carefully controlled as too high a level brings negative effects. Sulphur dioxide reacts with anthocyanins that are responsible for color in red wines. If there is excessive sulphur dioxide present, it renders the anthocyanins inert causing a wine to lose color. Furthermore, volatile sulphur dioxide smells and affects the aroma profile of a wine, while dissolved sulphur dioxide can be tasted and can negatively affect its flavor. A key reason behind warning label indicating that a wine contains sulphites is that some people may suffer allergic reaction due to it. Despite only affecting a small percentage of the population, it is a health risk that propels recent trends for lower level of sulphur dioxide used in winemaking.</p>
<p>Being both an antioxidant and antiseptic, sulphur dioxide is an important additive in winemaking. When correctly used, it ensures safety and freshness of wines until they reach the dinner table. The ill-effects of excessive sulphur dioxide use are obvious and have prompted a trend toward much lower level or in some cases, none at all. Alternative techniques are available, but they present another set of challenges and drawbacks. Good winemaking involves careful and controlled use of sulphur dioxide to protect and preserve the finished wine.</p>";"1";"2013-07-17 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:46:17";"sulphur-dioxide-in-winemaking";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Sulphur Dioxide, Winemaking, Production, Wines";"What is the role of sulphur dioxide in winemaking, and why it should matter to you!

"61";"Are All Champagnes Created Equal?";"<p>For centuries, the name Champagne has come out above all others when it comes to sparkling wine. The wineries of this very special region of France have been carefully perfecting their produce for hundreds of years and building up a legendary reputation around themselves in the meantime, with many of the most famous brands of their fizzy white wine becoming household names.</p>
<p>How did this happen? Many people would claim that we can place the blame for this perhaps over-inflated sense of importance on European royalty. The sparkling wines of Champagne were favoured by aristocracy of the past few centuries, leading the wineries of this region to boost their production and their prices simultaneously. To this day, few people regularly drink Champagne, and it is reserved for birthdays, anniversaries or the launching of ships.</p>
<p>The quality of the produce cannot be completely ignored, and a fine Champagne is a very carefully constructed and wonderful thing in itself. The delicate blending of Chardonnay varietal grapes with Pinot Noir, boosted by a little touch of Pinot Meunier is one of the all-time great combinations. The Chardonnay offers acidity, bite, and the distinctive biscuity flavours the wine holds; the other two varietals give their length and backbone, coming through in elegant bubbles during the second fermentation of the wine. The result is something splendid &ndash; delicate, giddy and exciting, with a taste quite unlike any other sparkling wine.</p>
<p>It has been a great source of frustration that the wineries of Champagne have allowed their reputation to overshadow any significant develop in the field of sparkling wines. Even in the Champagne region, wineries producing sparkling wines which differ from the norm are struggling to get noticed, due to the fact that the people who buy sparkling wines around the world are still nervous about exploring new options. The best of these overshadowed varieties is the superb &lsquo;blanc de noir&rsquo; sparkling Champagne, which are a single variety wine made exclusively with Pinot Noir grapes, giving a really impressive flavour with a hint of orchard fruits behind the decadent fizz of the drink.</p>
<p>If other, alternative, wineries in Champagne are struggling with their sparkling wines, then the rest of the world needs to start taking notice of the plight of wineries in other countries trying to get people to select their (often extremely good) sparkling wines. Spain&rsquo;s Cava wines have long been seen as an affordable, cheerful alternative to Champagne. Cavas tend to be slightly more fruity than other sparkling wines, and the ros&eacute; varieties are a delightful addition to the world of fizzy wines which have long been left under the radar of most wine drinkers, despite being treasured in their native Spain.</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s Prosecco wines are another great example of a sparkling wine too often cruelly overlooked on the shelf. Indeed, many people who take the time to try a few different Prosecco sparklers generally return to them, claiming they prefer the softness and drinkability of these fine, fizzy wines. Prosecco has less acidity than Champagne, with a more refined, blushed and rounded flavour which shows plenty more variation from winery to winery. Furthermore, Prosecco itself is versatile, and doesn&rsquo;t have such a sacrosanct air about it &ndash; get yourself a bottle and use it as the base for some of the best cocktails you&rsquo;ll have all year!</p>
<p>All over the world, from South Africa to California, wineries are consistently producing excellent quality sparkling wines which have plenty to offer, and importantly, are not necessarily trying to emulate Champagne. Even England, whose wine industry is just starting to get underway, has done very well at many tastings. Unfortunately, so long as the (admittedly, very good) sparkling wines of Champagne continue to dominate the minds and choices of wine buyers, this great variety of wines with all their unique flavours, aromas and characteristics will begin to dwindle, and possibly disappear.

"63";"Corks or Screw caps?";"<p>To cork or not to cork? Sounds familiar? Well, it should, this book written by George M Taber is all about the continuous battle between the traditional cork and its arch nemesis, the screw cap; a debate that has haunted all wine lovers for many generations. Which is better? Which is best for storage? These questions lead to more, and when one problem is solved another arises. The debate between which is a better way to seal off a bottle of wine is a long and tiresome road, but it is a very important one in the wine industry. To understand the battle let us review what is so important about the cork and what is so amazing about the screw cap.</p>
<p>Traditionally, wine bottles have been sealed by corks. Corks are very environmentally friendly because the part of the tree that is used to produce corks is the bark, which is an easily renewable resource. Corks also allow for natural aging. They are one of the few kinds of top that allow wine to age naturally. Because corks allow for natural breathing, the wine they seal can age on its own. This is very desirable for red wines.</p>
<p>Although there are many good qualities to corking a wine, probably the best reason for corking a wine is that nothing compares to the traditional, dramatic, and romantic sound of a cork popping out as you open the bottle. Too many wines are far more complex than how most people see it. It has history and hundreds of years of traditions that come with the bottle and the corks are just as important in that tradition as the bottle itself.</p>
<p>Although the cork does hold a lot of sentimental value and is a great way to store your wine there are a couple problems with the cork. One of the biggest problems with using a cork is that sometimes the wine will react to a substance called 2, 4, 6 &ndash; Tricloroanisole, which is caused by the bark from the tree, because sometimes mold will grow in it. This causes the wine to become &ldquo;corked&rdquo; wine. A lot of wines get this problem and it is because of the cork itself. Another problem with using a cork is since the cork is made from all natural bark and it does allow the wine to breath, oxygen can get into the wine and too much can cause the wine to become oxidized. Oxidation completely alters the flavor, texture and smell of the wine. Just as bad is that sometimes corks are very difficult to remove; they can crumble and break apart instead.</p>
<p>Screw caps are small metal caps that screw onto the neck of the bottle. The introduction of screw caps met with a lot of resistance, but now they are fairly common. Screw caps have the big advantage of preventing wines from becoming corked or becoming oxidized. Another advantage is that they are always very easy to remove, and do not require the use of a special tool like a cork does. Just as screw caps are easy to open, they are also easy to close, which is convenient if you don&rsquo;t drink the whole bottle. White wines are often found with screw caps, because they keep the wine fresh.</p>
<p>However, because screw caps are machine-made from metal or plastic, they are not renewable, and they contribute significantly to landfill. Screw caps also seal the opening of the bottle, which limits the benefits of the aging process. The biggest flaw in the screw cap is basically the same thing as the corks biggest strength, although it does help prevent a lot of taint, it stripes the tradition aspect of the wine, the cork is naturally grown like the wine and the beauty behind it, some wine enthusiasts will say that the screw cap is too man-made and doesn&rsquo;t have enough of that personal touch that corks do.</p>
<p>This debate between corks and screw caps have been argues for so many years and there are many valid points in both sides. There isn&rsquo;t a lot of hard proof that proves one makes the wine better but there are a lot of ideas and opinions. The truth is that it&rsquo;s based on personal preference.</p>";"1";"2013-07-17 00:00:00";"2015-04-21 01:48:09";"corks-or-screw-caps";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Wine Bottles, Screw Caps, Corks";"Does the use of a cork or a screw cap affect the quality or flavor of a wine?

<p>Beaujolais has gained its fame mostly from the young, fruity Beaujolais Nouveaux that appear on the market every November within weeks of harvest. However, this region that sits just south of Ma&ccedil;onnais, Burgundy deserves a deeper look.</p>
<p>Although all the red wines produced in the region are made from Gamay, the quality fluctuates significantly depending on where within Beaujolais the wines come from and who the producers are. Beaujolais Nouveau is mostly produced via carbonic maceration which leads to simple, fruity and low-tannin red wine that has little structure or complexity.</p>
<p>Toward the north of the region, along rolling hills with granite soil, more serious versions of Beaujolais can be found.

<p>Beaujolais has gained its fame mostly from the young, fruity Beaujolais Nouveaux that appear on the market every November within weeks of harvest. However, this region that sits just south of Ma&ccedil;onnais, Burgundy deserves a deeper look.</p>
<p>Although all the red wines produced in the region are made from Gamay, the quality fluctuates significantly depending on where within Beaujolais the wines come from and who the producers are. Beaujolais Nouveau is mostly produced via carbonic maceration which leads to simple, fruity and low-tannin red wine that has little structure or complexity.</p>
<p>Toward the north of the region, along rolling hills with granite soil, more serious versions of Beaujolais can be found. They are recognized for their higher quality by designation &ldquo;Beaujolais Villages.&rdquo; Several villages are further elevated as individual &ldquo;crus&rdquo; to denote their superior quality. R&eacute;gni&eacute; is one of the crus &mdash; one that is cherished for its ballerina-like lightness and youthful appeal.</p>

<p>In 1966, David Lett went against the advice of his viticulture professors at UC Davis and went to Oregon to plant the first Pinot Noir vineyard in the Willamette Valley. His perseverance and dedication has paid off and placed Oregon on the wine map as synonymous with the best and most elegant Pinot Noir in the US.</p>
<p>Today, his vineyards have been passed down to his son, Jason Lett, who carries forth the same principle of not conforming and seeking to make the best wine possible with the vineyards that his father planted.</p>
<p>Even though Pinot Noir got all the spotlight, David Lett&rsquo;s wife Diana shared &ldquo;he really loved making Chardonnay even though all the fuss was about Pinot Noir, and Pinot Gris to a certain extent. He always liked that there was no 108 [a Chardonnay clone isolated by UC Davis in 1967 for its high yield and low acid and gained tremendous popularity in California] in the wines at all, except for a couple of the purchased vintages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persistance and the goal to strive for excellence today continue with very demanding biodynamic regimens. There is no spraying of herbicide and insecticide. Vines are non-irrigated and un-grafted, with minimal intervention and 100% hand harvesting. The vines average 50 years old and were planted in 2 adjacent blocks in the original Eyrie Vineyards facing south and southeast in iron-rich limestone soil.</p>
<p>In the cellar, the wine was allowed to ferment slowly over a period of several months in large neutral French barrels with indigenous yeast, followed by extended ageing on lees for 1 year and then lightly filtered before bottling.</p>
<p>There are plenty of blockbuster Chardonnays made these days that wow you on the first sip, even if subsequent sips tend to become tiring on the palate. We like to see The Eyrie Chardonnay as a long-distance runner. This is a wine that gets better over the course of dinner. Decanting is not common for white wine, but we think this wine could benefit from a quick decanting. With some time in glass, red apple, hints quince and pineapple start to reveal themselves. This wine shows a leesy quality with a smooth softened texture and continues to open up to reveal a Meursault-like quality with its rich mouthfeel and hazelnut note. Oak is subtle and integrated. Finish is clean and elegant.</p>
<p>Its structure is built for the long haul as evidenced by a recent 1970-2007 Chardonnay retrospective tasting attended by Jancis Robinson MW. She marveled at how well the wines aged: &ldquo;Indeed these wines showed practically no obvious oak notes whatsoever &ndash; and were much lighter, drier, and longer- lived, than most North American Chardonnays&hellip;.I had to go back and alter my suggested drinking dates for the younger vintages on the basis of how well the older wines had lasted. And by the time we had got back to the 1980s and 1970s, I started wondering just how many Burgundian domaines could present an array of white wines that has lasted as consistently well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As far as Oregon goes, the Eyrie Vineyards is considered THE vino-royalty. If it weren&rsquo;t for the Lett family, we would be missing out on some very distinguished wines. Pinot Noir gets the spotlight but Chardonnay is well deserving of an equal share on the stage too.</p>

<p>C&ocirc;tes du Ventoux is a small appellation located in the Southern Rh&ocirc;ne Valley. Its name may not mean much but lovers of Rh&ocirc;ne Valley Syrah should take note of this producer &ndash; Domaine de Fondr&egrave;che. This cuvee Persia, as it is closer in expression to the more majestic Northern Rh&ocirc;ne (think C&ocirc;te-R&ocirc;tie and Cornas) than to most of its Grenache-based neighbors in the South. This recently arrived, late-release 2007, with its brooding structure, is 90% Syrah and 10% Mourv&egrave;dre. We think the extra time spent in the cellar is well justified and doing great things to the wine.</p>
<p>The wine has just been rested enough and is in its prime drinking window. Showing a deep intensity of blue-tinged red, at 5 years of age, it opens up to show attractive nose of savory meat (Yes, bacon!), provencÄ…l herbs and dried violets. On palate, notes of rich but fresh blackberries and sweet licorice are framed by a structure of rounded soft tannin and great acidity.</p>
<p>Domaine Fondr&egrave;che works biodynamically at its cool high-elevation vineyard (temperature here tends to be lower than other areas of southern Rh&ocirc;ne) with minimal sulphur dioxide. All wines are bottled unfined and unfiltered.</p>
<p>Cuv&eacute;e Persia consistently garners 90+ scores from the Wine Advocate (Robert Parker gave the 2007 92 points and Neal Martin 93 points) but don&rsquo;t hold it against the wine. It is classically well-balanced with a long, graphite-laced, minerally finish.</p>

<p>In 1966, David Lett went against the advice of his viticulture professors at UC Davis and went to Oregon to plant the first Pinot Noir vineyard in the Willamette Valley. We all remember the rant from Miles in Sideways about how finicky and difficult this thin-skinned grape is. David Lett proved all naysayers wrong and produced a high quality Pinot Noir that wasn&rsquo;t seen domestically at the time. Today, Willamette Valley in Oregon is synonymous with the best and most elegant Pinot Noir in the US.</p>
<p>After multiple trips to Burgundy and classes at UC Davis, in 1983, Jim Bernau, a Pinot Noir enthusiast and Oregon native, purchased the land that makes up today&rsquo;s Willamette Valley Vineyards and planted the first 15 acres of Pinot Noir in what is known today as South Block. Using a small tractor, he cleared the land of old blackberry vines and plum orchard and replaced them with Burgundian clones of Pinot Noir (namely Pommard, Wadenswil, Dijon 667 and 777). The soil is a red iron rich volanic clay that is similar to the red clay found in the famed grand cru vineyard of Roman&eacute;e St Vivant in Burgundy.</p>
<p>Each vineyard lot is fermented and barreled separately with the aim of identifying uniqueness of each plot. They are used to produce elegantly balanced Pinot Noir reflective of their origin and soil.</p>
<p>South Block is the original vineyard planted in 1983 by Jim Bernau. Its limited production of 10 barrels shows a medium-bodied character filled with fresh cherry and raspberry notes, with a touch of spice box and well-integrated oak. The wines spent 13 months in 54% new French oak which attributed to its subtle vanilla and sweet spice character and a rounded texture. Mouth-filling volume, rounded tannin and a plush texture, together with its lightness on palate, this is a Pinot Noir that is easy to love and is friendly with food. Its long lingering finish and elegant balance (with a very sensible 13.5% abv) remind us of its indisputable Oregonian root.</p>
<p>As a side note, we like to think that we&rsquo;ve pulled plenty of corks on a daily basis but this is the first cork that we notice being sourced from a sustainably managed forest that is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. Organically grown grapes, sustainably minded production methodology, classically balanced and layered wines, it is no surprise that the Willamette Valley Vineyards was named the Wine and Spirits&rsquo; Winery of the Year in 2011.</p>

<p>Crozes-Hermitage is situated along the eastern bank of the Rh&ocirc;ne River in the northern Rh&ocirc;ne. It is a region known for its red wine made from predominantly Syrah but it can be blended with up to 15% Marsanne and Roussanne. White Crozes-Hermitage is also produced from Marsanne and Roussanne but it remains a small percentage of total production.</p>
<p>This easy-drinking Syrah is a result of blending from various hillside parcels with old vines averaging 40 years old. Fermentation and ageing were carried out in neutral vats to preserve more fruit characters. Fresh black cherries and bramble berries are evident on the attack followed by hints of dried herbs and peppery notes. Tannins are elegant and well-resolved thanks to a few years of bottle age. It is expressive and accessible with lovely berry fruits. Pair this with any grilled meat but reach for the dry-rub instead of heavy BBQ sauces.</p>

Fermentation and ageing were carried out in neutral vats to preserve more fruit characters. Fresh black cherries and bramble berries are evident on the attack followed by hints of dried herbs and peppery notes. Tannins are elegant and well-resolved thanks to a few years of bottle age. It is expressive and accessible with lovely berry fruits. Pair this with any grilled meat but reach for the dry-rub instead of heavy BBQ sauces.</p>

Vintners are responding to consumer demands for more sustainable viniculture and packaging options, and they&rsquo;re getting creative in the process. Wine kegs, paper bottles and water conservation initiatives are just some of the steps vintners are taking to protect the environment while producing delicious fine wines.</p>
<h2>Wine Kegs Cut Costs and Meet Sustainability Goals</h2>
<p>Restaurants that sell wine by the glass typically buy it in kegs, just like beer. These containers keep the wine fresh until the last glass is poured, so restaurants can buy high-quality wines at bulk discount prices to serve to their customers without the fear of losing wines due to oxidization.</p>
<p>Reusable wine kegs are cleaned and returned to the winery to be filled with more wine. That process can increase the wine&rsquo;s carbon footprint, both in terms of the resources used to clean the keg and those used to transport it back and forth from the winery. New, recyclable wine kegs from a German company known as Shafer Container Systems can be added to curbside recycling, saving the cost of cleaning and transporting the keg back and forth to the winery.</p>

"73";"How Do Tannins Influence the Taste of Wine?";"<h1><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1239"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/vineyard-red-grapes-300x200.jpg"" alt=""Vineyard red grapes"" width=""300"" height=""200"" /></p>
<p>Tannins are natural plant compounds found in the stems, seeds and skins of wine grapes. They&rsquo;re also found in many other foods, like walnuts and tea leaves. The tannins in wine are what give it its texture and help it to age. As wine ages, the tannins separate from the liquid and find their way to the bottom of the bottle as sediment, in a process known as <a onclick=""javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://winemakermag.com']);"" href=""http://winemakermag.com/1045-tannin-chemistry-techniques"">polymerization</a>.</p>
<h2>Processing Affects Tannin Levels</h2>
<p>A wine&rsquo;s tannin content depends on the type of grapes used to make it and how those grapes are processed. Red grapes have more tannins, so <a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/red-wine.html"">red wines</a> are typically more tannic than white wines, although white wines can also have a high level of tannins.</p>
<p>Vintners take the tannic content of their grapes into account in deciding when to harvest and how to make their wines. Some varietals of grape are naturally low in tannins, like <a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/red-wine/pinot-noir.html"">pinot noir</a>, for example. Such varietals may be fermented &ldquo;whole cluster,&rdquo; with their stems included, to give the wine more tannins and a richer, more substantial texture. More tannic grapes, like syrah and <a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/red-wine/cabernet-sauvignon.html"">cabernet sauvignon</a>, are generally fermented without the stems.</p>
<p>How the grapes are pressed also affects the tannin content of the wine. For a lighter, less tannic wine, the vintner will give grapes a lighter pressing. A firm pressing squeezes more tannins out of the grape seeds, leading to a bolder, more tannic wine.</p>
<p>Vintners may soften young wine during the fermentation process using a technique called <a onclick=""javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.vinovation.com']);"" href=""http://www.vinovation.com/MOxmain.htm"">micro-oxygenation</a>, which exposes the fermenting wine to small and carefully controlled amounts of oxygen. The barrels in which the wine is aged can also influence its tannic content. New barrels can significantly reduce a wine&rsquo;s tannin content. For this reason, most vintners prefer older barrels that have already been used to ferment a few vintages.</p>
<h2>How to Taste the Tannins in Wine</h2>
<p>The way tannins influence the flavor of a wine is less a matter of taste and more a matter of texture. Wine is said to be <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/red-wine.html""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1238"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/pouring-red-wine-into-glass-200x300.jpg"" alt=""Pouring red wine into glass"" width=""200"" height=""300"" /></a>astringent, firm or supple, depending on how tannic it is.</p>
<p>Though the other flavors in the wine, such as its fruitiness or sweetness, can certainly work in harmony with its tannins, a very tannic wine will have an overwhelmingly astringent, bitter texture. You will feel this bitterness throughout your mouth, in the back of your throat, on your gums and on the inside of your cheeks. Such a wine needs to be aged before drinking.</p>
<p>When you taste a firm wine, you&rsquo;ll be able to distinguish the grape flavors interacting with the tannins, which you may perceive as a sensation of bitterness at the back of your throat. A tannic wine will also leave your mouth feeling dry after you swallow it. Supple wines with lower tannic contents will leave no feeling of bitterness at all.</p>
<p>A common mistake when tasting wine is to confuse its acid content with it tannin content. A tannic wine leaves your mouth feeling dry. If your mouth begins to water immediately after you swallow the wine, any bitterness you perceived was the result of its acid content, not its tannins.</p>
<p>Very tannic wines should be paired with red meats, while less tannic wines can be paired with seafood, poultry or vegetables. Learning to taste the tannins in wine can help you choose the wines that will best complement your meals.</p>";"1";"2014-05-14 00:00:00";"2015-04-20 21:17:12";"how-do-tannins-influence-the-taste-of-wine";"citywinecellar";"Danny Gorny";"Wine Flavor, Tannins";"Learning about how tannins influence the flavor of wine will help you make the perfect decision for dinner or cheese pairings.

Wine is said to be <a href=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/pouring-red-wine-into-glass.jpg""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1238"" src=""http://citywinecellar.com/media/wysiwyg/2014/05/pouring-red-wine-into-glass-200x300.jpg"" alt=""Pouring red wine into glass"" width=""200"" height=""300"" /></a>astringent, firm or supple, depending on how tannic it is.</p>
<p>Though the other flavors in the wine, such as its fruitiness or sweetness, can certainly work in harmony with its tannins, a very tannic wine will have an overwhelmingly astringent, bitter texture. You will feel this bitterness throughout your mouth, in the back of your throat, on your gums and on the inside of your cheeks. Such a wine needs to be aged before drinking.</p>
<p>When you taste a firm wine, you&rsquo;ll be able to distinguish the grape flavors interacting with the tannins, which you may perceive as a sensation of bitterness at the back of your throat. A tannic wine will also leave your mouth feeling dry after you swallow it. Supple wines with lower tannic contents will leave no feeling of bitterness at all.</p>
<p>A common mistake when tasting wine is to confuse its acid content with it tannin content. A tannic wine leaves your mouth feeling dry. If your mouth begins to water immediately after you swallow the wine, any bitterness you perceived was the result of its acid content, not its tannins.</p>
<p>Very tannic wines should be paired with red meats, while less tannic wines can be paired with seafood, poultry or vegetables. Learning to taste the tannins in wine can help you choose the wines that will best complement your meals.</p>"

It is true that sometimes people tend to drink a little bit more than they should when they are enjoying a fine wine. However, real gourmands who love to keep their sense of taste with refined tastes on every meal should definitely keep an eye of what kind of wine they will drink during the meal. It can be a fun pairing exercise to do this, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not always easy to make a choice and you can sometimes see people in wine shops that are wandering around the aisles trying to figure out what will make their guests at the dinner satisfied. The truth is that there are wines that are appropriate for every type of meal, you just have to know how to choose them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Red Meat</h3>
<p><a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/red-wine.html"">Red wine</a> is the perfect option for roast beef, steak, barbecue or steak in sauce. One of the other most popular types of wine for these meals is Cabernet Sauvignon. Another wine grape variety that is suitable is the popular Merlot. Those who enjoy more intense tastes can have Chianti. Many people use this wine with venison. Brunello is another popular choice when it comes to venison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Lamb</h3>
<p>People who love lamb meat, especially baked lamb will also enjoy drinking Cabernet Sauvignon and merlot with it. In addition they can try black Pinot too. If you want to try something that is out of the ordinary you can try the sweeter Californian Zinfandel. This wine matches the taste of pork and you won&rsquo;t be wrong if you choose Merlot with this meat. In addition, &nbsp;you should try French Beaujolais as well as the fruity, light and sweet Dolcetto.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Veal</h3>
<p>Red wine is suitable for veal too. You&rsquo;ll have everything under control if you serve it with the previously mentioned Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chianti, but you can also opt for a slightly acrid black Pinot that provides slightly stringing taste. This wine is an excellent choice if you choose to serve roasted duck or rabbit. Fine wine and wine with fuller flavor and strong aroma like Shyrasa will make the veal tastier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Poultry</h3>
<p>Chicken and turkey meat are interesting because you can use both white and black wine with them. Turkey steaks or turkey in a combination with pasta or rice will pair well with Beaujolais and Zinfandel.Roasted turkey, however, can be served with black Pinot or a wine with a slightly sour taste, like Riesling. This wine combines both sweet and bitter flavors. Deliciously roasted chicken meat will have an even better taste when you drink Merlot or Zinfandel with it. Some other recipes with this popular meat will look and taste better with Chardonnay which combines sweet, bitter and sour tastes in the best possible way. Finally, you can't really go wrong if you select white light Pinot wine.</p>";"1";"2015-02-11 18:57:00";"2015-06-12 21:22:08";"pairingwinewithfood";"Beth Anne Jackson";"Stacey Bullington";;;"0";"fine dining, wine pairing, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Chianti, white wine, Chardonnay";"<p><a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/red-wine.html""><img style=""float: left;"" alt="""" src=""http://www.made-in-italy.com/files/imagecache/lg/pictures/italian-wine/regions/grapes-bottle-and-glass-of-red-wine.jpg"" height=""249"" width=""327"" /></a>Having a meal with good company, a pleasant atmosphere and a glass of good wine cannot go wrong.

"75";"How to Select the Best Wine Gift";"<p>When attending a party of any sort, it can sometimes be difficult to select the proper courtesy gift. For fancy dinner parties and social events, a bottle of wine is a great gift option to consider. Not only is it classy, but it is also versatile and can be tailored to your specific needs, comes in a variety of price ranges and you can even buy wine online. There are many things to consider that will help you select the perfect wine gift for your host.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Think About the Receiver</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you decide to give wine as a gift, consider the person you are giving it to. If you don&rsquo;t know them very well, wine is something you can select if you'd like to introduce someone else to the joys of drinking wine. Consider your host and make sure that wine would actually be a good gift for them and if they would enjoy it or not. Choosing wine for someone who would not appreciate it is sure to leave a bad taste in his or her mouth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Consider the Right Type of Wine</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Wine is very versatile and there are many different types of wine out there to be considered. Here are a few things to keep in mind in terms of selecting the right kind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about your host and consider their tastes, especially if you know them well. If you are unsure about their preferences, a simple generic type of white-wine or red-wine will work perfectly.</li>
<li>Chardonnay, Champagne or Merlot are great options for generic wines that most people love. Try to avoid sweet wines, as most people do not enjoy those.</li>
<li>Think about how much you want to spend on the wine as well as what the style of your individual is.</li>
<li>There are nice wine selections in any price range from new-york wine to rose-wine and a good rule of thumb is to spend between twenty and fifty dollars. It all depends on your host and their general preference.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Presentation is Everything</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>After you have selected the perfect wine for your gift, think about the presentation. For a general token of appreciation, and a more casual style, an unwrapped bottle is preferred. Other options include giving it in a fancy wine holder or simply wrapping it with a bag and tissue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/accessories.html""><strong>Gizmos and Gadgets</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you want to achieve a more elaborate gift, consider including various gadgets to go along with it. A wine bar kit that includes a corkscrew and other various tools is a great option. A cheese palate or other wine accessories can make that gift truly pop. It all goes back to thinking about the host and what he or she will prefer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wine can be a truly great gift of appreciation to someone and can be enjoyed by virtually anyone. If you are considering getting wine as a gift to your host or hostess, think about these pointers and be sure to select the perfect one. Buying and giving the perfect wine can make an impression that will last for ages to come.</p>

<p>There are many different occasions where people give <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/wine-and-liquor-gifts.html"">wine as a gift</a>. Whether it is a bottle of wine for a new father or a Christmas present for the special woman in your life, you don't want to go with just dull wrapping paper and a bow. A good red or white wine is meant to be savored, so the package that wine comes in should be savored as well. Whether you're <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/red-wine.html"">buying red wine</a> or <a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/white-wine.html"">white wine</a>, the wrapping can really make your gift stand out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read on below for some festive ideas on how to wrap the wine gift that you intend to give, no matter what the occasion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bundle it Up</h3>
<p>If you are giving the gift of wine to a new or expectant father, you will want to dress the wine bottle up in style. You can knit a teeny hat and scarf to go over the bottle, or if you aren't handy with a needle and yarn, you can buy one instead. Make sure that they are blue or pink, in order to celebrate the occasion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Give it Rustic Frills</h3>
<p>Burlap bags have long been a Christmassy way to wrap a bottle of wine. If you have a friend that loves wine, but is a rustic country type person, then wrapping the wine in rustic frills, will satisfy their every need. Make sure to choose festive burlap and don't forget to add a little metallic paint and a silver ribbon to dress the package up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Instant Labeling</h3>
<p>If you are invited to a last minute Christmas party next season and need to carry a bottle of wine, pull one from your own stash. Of course, you don't want it to look like you did just that, so print an instant label with Merry Christmas and a festive tag on it, wrap the wine in it, and head out the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Wrap it in a Cozy Sweater</h3>
<p>If you are heading out to a party in the dead of winter and want to present your host with a bottle of wine, you can dress it up in a cozy sweater fit for the season. You can simply take the sleeves off sweaters that have seen better days and wrap the wine in one. You have a gorgeous, colorful gift of wine and you didn't have to spend a dime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sock Time</h3>
<p>If you have a tall bottle of wine that you can't find the right packaging for, then get out a pair of argyle socks and start wrapping. Make sure you choose an immaculately clean pair of course. An argyle sock is just the right size and height to wrap a tall bottle of red wine in and it will look festive as well.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the great and festive ways you can make the expensive wine you brought for a gift look even classier. From gift-wrapping it in an argyle sock to dressing it up in baby hats and a little shirt, you can be sure that the gift of wine you give will keep on giving, long after the bottle is gone.&nbsp;</p>";"1";"2015-03-04 12:53:46";"2015-06-12 20:07:24";"wrappingawinegift";"Beth Anne Jackson";"Stacey Bullington";;;"0";"wine gift, buy wine gifts online, wine gift wrapping, wine bags";"<p><a href=""https://citywinecellar.com/accessories.html""><img style=""float: left;"" alt="""" src=""http://i62.tinypic.com/ina4p0.jpg"" height=""227"" width=""341"" /></a></p>
