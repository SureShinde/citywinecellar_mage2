<p style=""text-align: center;"">Pinot Gris is a relative of Pinot Blanc and also is a variety of Vitis Vinifers, a clone or mutation of Pinot Noir.  The Gris in its name stands for grey in French and the Pinot stands for pine cone for the shape of the grayish-blue clusters.  There is a long history that dates back to the Middle Ages where it was spread to Switzerland from the Burgundy region.  It was then brought to Hungary by Cistercian monks where it developed the name Szurkebarat which means grey monk.  Pinot Gris is a mild, fragrant and light citrus lemon flavored depending on how ripe the grapes are at harvest.  Some Italian versions are drier as compared to other regions.  The wine should be served chilled and pairs well with foods that have high acidity.  Citrus fruits, light cheese, to tomato based recipes work well with this wine.</p>";NULL;NULL;"left";"4";"0";"0";NULL;"1";"a:7:{s:4:""type"";s:34:""amlanding/filter_condition_combine"";s:9:""attribute"";N;s:8:""operator"";N;s:5:""value"";s:1:""1"";s:18:""is_value_processed"";N;s:10:""aggregator"";s:3:""all"";s:10:""conditions"";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:""type"";s:34:""amlanding/filter_condition_product"";s:9:""attribute"";s:11:""dominantvar"";s:8:""operator"";s:2:""=="";s:5:""value"";s:3:""177"";s:18:""is_value_processed"";b:0;}}}";NULL;"1";NULL

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Corvina is a grape varietal from Italy. It goes by many names and is referred to also as Corvina Veronese, Cassabria, and Cruina. Mainly found in the Veneto region of Italy, it is blended with several other varietals to produce light red wines like Bardolino, Valpolicella , Amarone and Recioto. This light to medium bodied wine can sometimes display tartness with hints of sour cherry. Corvina grapes have thick skin and low tannins. It ripens late and is usually confused with Corvinone which is generally used in straw wines which are sweet raisin like wine similar to ice wine. DNA profiling proved that these two grapes are different from each other. The grapes can be difficult to cultivate. They are small blue-black color and very resistant to rot. This grape makes up the majority of most blends in Bardolino and Valpolicella. Valpolicella are the second largest Controlled Appellation wine and goes well with soups, stews and pastas. Amarone wine is one of the best wines coming out of Italy. This grape is one of the most expressive grapes in blends and is considered one of the best grapes in Northeastern Italy. Some of these blends also contain Rondinella and Molinara. When Corvina is aged in barrels it adds more structure and complexity to this light crimson coloring.</p>

In Campagnia , this grape is used to make the wine Greco di Tufo, while in Calabria, Greco di Bianco is produced more. The short term Greco is mostly referred to the grape Greco Bianco even though there is more land dedicated to the Graco nero grape. Being of Greek origin, this grape has a long history behind it. Imported to southern Italy over 2,000 years ago by the Greeks, this grape was believed to be a part of a Roman blended wine of Aminean and Falernian. The grapes mature late and is prone to disease. The vine is described as being a winged cluster. The darker varietal gives off a deep color while the white versions tend to have more aromatic qualities. In Calabria, clones of Greco bianco have been used in sweet dessert wines while on Capri, Greco is blended with Falanghina to make a dry wine. Greco is also commonly blended with Malvasia and many other varietals.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: center;""><span>Chardonnay, America's number one selling white wine varietal, continues to climb the production ladders to emerge as the most beloved of dry white wines in the U.S. The Chardonnay grape itself also contributes to the wine's popularity. It is a relatively &ldquo;low-maintenance&rdquo; vine that adapts well to a variety of climates, resulting in fairly high yields worldwide. These high yields translate into millions of bottles of Chardonnay wines. As a result, you can buy a good bottle of Chardonnay for under $15.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: center;""><span>Rich is the word that best both describes Chardonnay and explains its popularity. Its aroma is distinct, yet delicate, difficult to characterize, easier to recognize. It often smells like apples, lemons, peaches or tropical fruits. Its delicacy is such that even a small percentage of another varietal blended into a chardonnay will often &nbsp;completely dominate its aroma and flavor. Oak commonly takes over Chardonnay if the wine is fermented or aged in new barrels or for too long in seasoned ones.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: center;""><span>With a long and distinguished following, Chardonnay enjoys a very versatile image, with vintners offering a broad range of styles and structures. From rich, buttery Chardonnays that boast power and presence to the unoaked fruit-forward Chardonnays that allow the varietal character and expression to be in the spotlight, this white wine is capable of accomodating most palates and just as many food pairing combinations.</span></p>

Traminer is a variety of grape that takes it name from a village in Northern Italy named Tramin which spoke German. First grown in Alscae around the 19th century, the green skinned grape believed to be a relative of Sauvignon Blanc and Voigner, mutated into a pink skinned grape called Red Traminer or Sauvignon Rose. &nbsp;The thick, tough skin can contain very highly concentrated sugar levels which can lead to higher alcohol levels. Somehow throughout history it wound up to be the Gewurztraminer we know today. The characteristics of these grapes can range from dark pink, dark to light, golden, yellow copper tone coloring with a fuller &nbsp;body than other white wines. The aromatics and sweetness of these wines depend on when they are harvested. Gewurztraminer is very difficult to grow and is very susceptible to frost, disease, and ripens early. Gewurztraimer is sweeter than Riesling, thick and rich with great aging ability. It pairs well with seasoned, spicy dishes like Mexican, Asian and could even be a dessert wine served chilled. &nbsp;The aromas of Gewurztraminer are similar to the lychee juice and share many of the same chemical compounds.</span></p>

The name Primitivo derives from primativus and primaticcio describing the characteristics of the grape. &nbsp;The origins were believed to originate around 6000 B.C. in the Caucasus area in Eurasia and later in the 18th century was brought to Italy. The wine produced is deep, rich, and has flavors of zesty cherry, clove, wild blackberry, raspberry and spice. &nbsp;European label laws made it difficult for the names of Zinfandel and Primitivo to be interchangeable. Primitivo wines tend to be juicy, well structured, heavy pigment and high in alcohol. &nbsp;The Primitivo grapes are robust with a lot of sugar which raises the alcohol level in the wine.</p>

<p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Tempranillo vines prefer a cooler climate and have low resistance to many vine diseases and pests. &nbsp;The vines themselves tolerate heat well; however, the fruit develops indistinct flavors and undesirable characteristics in warm climes. &nbsp;</span></p>

Also, to maintain the quality of the wines it produces, it is crucial for the wine makers to check the yields of grapes per vine. &nbsp;The Sangiovese vine is notorious for overproduction which can lessen the quality of the wine.</p>
<p></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The high acidity and light body characteristics of the Sangiovese grapes exhibit a problem for winemakers. &nbsp;The grape&rsquo;s weak coloring comes from lack of the color-creating phenolic compounds. Today&rsquo;s winemakers have developed numerous techniques to add body and texture to Sangiovese wines. &nbsp;For example, winemakers have used grapes that come from extremely low yielding vines. Also, adjusting the temperature and the length of fermentation as well as employing extensive oak treatment contribute to strengthening the characteristics of Sangiovese. &nbsp;Some winemakers blend Sangiovese with other Italian varieties like Mammolo, Colorino, and Canaiolo to produce stronger and concentrated flavored wine such as Chianti. </span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>The tannins are soft and it is medium bodied. &nbsp;Carmenere has a cherry like fruity flavor with smoky, spicy notes. &nbsp;This varietal is one of the most ancient European varietals and a clone of Cabernet Sauvignon. &nbsp;The Carmenere grape has known origins in the Medoc area of France. It is almost impossible to find this varietal in France today because in 1867 Phylloxera almost wiped out all the vineyards in Europe. Thought to be extinct, Carmenere has been discovered to be thriving in Chile where this varietal was inadvertently preserved because the similar characteristics to Merlot. &nbsp;Chile modeled their wineries after those in France. The climate of Chile helped in the production of healthier crops. Grown mostly in the Colchagua Valley, Maipo, and Rapel Valley. A similar situation happened in Italy where they mistakenly thought Carmenere was Cabernet Franc but when the vines ripened earlier than Cabernet Franc and looked different in color and taste and they established these vines to be Carmenere. Carmenere may &nbsp;be a distant relative to Merlot even though there are major differences between the two. Carmenere is capable of making really good wine depending on the winemaker and his knowledge of this grape. The grapes take a long time to ripen and need a lot of heat to ripen. If harvested too early the wine will have a herbal aroma and a fruitier style with less balance. Carmenere is a great table wine and pairs well with food. Very good with vegetables and pasta dishes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

This grape is rare and is grown in the northern region of France. &nbsp;There was a time in the 1960&rsquo;s where the grape varietal almost became extinct. Since then the varietal has been planted around the world. Australia, California, New Zealand, Greece and South Africa have had some success growing this varietal. &nbsp;The DNA test conducted in 2004 showed that Viognier is a close relative to Freisa from the Piedmont region. Viognier is very difficult to grow and should only be picked when fully ripe. Well known for the floral aromas similar to those found in Riesling and Muscat, this wine is meant to be consumed young because it loses its perfume as it ages. &nbsp;Viognier is a great wine to pair with spicy foods like Thai, and Mexican cuisine. </span></p>

In the mid 19th century, the grape found its way to the United States, where it got its name Zinfandel. The taste depends on how ripe the grapes are but typically Zinfandel produces a robust wine. White Zinfandel is produced by removing the skins early during the process which accounts for its blush coloring. White Zinfandel sells six times more than red wine in the U.S. Zinfandel grows well in warm climates. The thinned skin grapes may shrivel in really hot climates and the vines are prone to bunch rot which makes it a little difficult to grow. The grapes tend to ripen early and produces juice with high sugar levels. Zinfandel is known to be rich, medium to high tannin with a dark color, with flavors of raspberry, cherry, plum, raisins, spice, black pepper and some contain higher alcohol levels due to the amount of sugar in the grape. Pairs well with poultry, lamb, stewed, grilled, or braised meats.</p>

It was then found in the 15th century in the Touraine area. Chenin Blanc is believed to be related or possibly a mutant of Pineau d&rsquo;Aunis also known as Chenin Noir. DNA testing suggests that Sauvignon Blanc may be an offspring of Chenin Blanc. The climate and harvesting time dictates whether the grapes will be sweet or dry. Harvest them too soon and the wine will be high in acidity. Chenin Blanc is a very vigorous and can be prone to over cropping. Chenin Blanc is very versatile and ages well.

There is some confusion about the differences in the name but this grape is mostly known as Grenache. Grown widely in Spain this grape is very important to the Rioja region. It is usually blended with Tempranillo and Priorat. Flavors of black pepper roasted game and sweet black fruits are some of the characteristics of this varietal. The history of this vine goes back and is used in many known and reputable wines with well known varietals. It ripens late and does well in hot, dry conditions. It has some spicy berry flavored notes but is soft on the palate with high alcohol content. Relatively adaptable to all types of soil, Granacha has thin skins and are lightly pigmented in color. This varietal is one of the most popular and planted varietals in the world and present in many Rhone styled wines. Grenache was one of the first grapes to be brought to Australia in the 18th century and it was the dominant choice for Australia until it was surpassed by Shiraz in the mid 1960s. In the 19th century, California favored Garnacha because of the high yields it is able to produce in hot climates. The vine buds required a long time to ripen and is one of the last grapes to be harvested. Garnacha ripens later than Cabernet Sauvignon which allows the sugars of the grapes able to reach high levels which in turn produce high alcohol content. It is susceptible to bunch rot and wet moist climates increase the dangers of rot. This is the primary grape found in Chateauneuf du Pape.</p>

Despite its fickle growing and fermentation nature, these grapes are surprisingly resistant to disease and mold. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Nebbiolo wines are grown in the cool hills of the Piedmont and Nebbiolo wines offer high acidity and tannins with light fruit flavors. &nbsp;Traditional styles of Nebbiolo wines should be aged several years to bring forward the best they have to offer. &nbsp;Look for Nebbiolo wines labeled as Barolo, Barbaresco, or Langhe Nebbiolo. &nbsp;Barolo, a region to the east of Alba in Piedmont, is the apex of Nebbiolo wines. &nbsp;Barbaresco, on the other side of Alba, tends to produce less severe Nebbiolo wines. &nbsp;A more affordable option for Nebbiolo wines come from the Langhe region. &nbsp;Nebbiolo wines from Langhe will exhibit its hallmark truffle and rose fragrance and dried cherry flavors.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Until recently, one could expect to wait at least ten years for a Barolo or Barbaresco to shed its initial tightness. However, production techniques have undergone some alterations, especially with Barolo, which is generally even more tannic than Barbaresco. A number of Barolo producers began dramatically shortening fermentation times and shifting from aging in large wooden casks to using some smaller French barriques. This strategy aimed to make Barolo accessible at an early age, as a response to the international market's need for instant gratification. We were somewhat concerned that this move went beyond necessary refinements in production and resulted in the loss of these wines' unique qualities. The world already has enough wines made in an indistinct, ""international"" style. However, if the differences in product between the traditionalists and the modernists were particularly sharp several years ago, we've found that at present a middle ground has emerged: moderate fermentation times and some combination of old casks and new barriques appear to be the order of the day. The best of these wines still benefit from 7-10 years of bottle-aging, but younger wines are now more approachable.</span></p>

It is a cross between the Cinsaut grape known as Hermitage and Pinot Noir. Originating around 1925, this grape produces a deep red wine with earthy, smoky flavors that is sometimes criticized for smelling like acetate or paint.These grapes are easy to grow and ripen early. The difficulty in cultivation these grapes are in controlling the volatile acidity which can make or break a wine. High in tannins this grape became the champion wine in 1959 in the Cape Wine Show. Pinotage is a new world wine with a majority coming from South Africa. There are other Pinotage grapes grown in other regions like Brazil, Isreal, New Zealand, U.S., and Canada. Apartheid restricted the popularity of the grapes but that soon changed as Apartheid ended which helped improve the popularity of the varietal. The wine has a unique fruity flavor with subtle hints of banana and a velvety texture. With great depth and good structure,this wine ages well and drinks like a mature Bordeaux as it ages. If you like light and fruity then this wine should be consumed early. The aim of this cross of Pinot Noir and Hermitage was to produce a grape with the best qualities of both parents. Professor Perold was successful in 1925 in creating a versatile easy to grow grape but they weren&rsquo;t very popular until the 1990&rsquo;s. This wine pairs well with winter bean soup, smoked duck, pulled pork and makes a good pizza wine as well.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>The Riax Baixes region is generally cool and moist with lots of wind and rain. &nbsp;The climate can often bring the onset of mildew and mold so the vines are trained high and opened to allow the circulation of air to dry the grapes. &nbsp;This prevents the grapes from the threat of rot, mildew and other fungal diseases. The aromas from this thick skinned grape are intense with scents of peaches, apples, flowers and almonds. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> Albarino wines are great to pair with seafood because they are light and high in acidity with the alcohol level of 11.5% to 12.5%. &nbsp;There is a bit of bitterness or tartness because of their thick skin and large number of pips, but nonetheless, very refreshing. Albarino wine goes very well with any kind of seafood. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are some things to consider before choosing Albarino wine: They should be consumed young and do not age very well. &nbsp;Albarino is now produced in many other regions for those interested in a nice clean, crisp and rich wine. Australian winemakers recently discovered through DNA tests that their Albarino was incorrectly labeled and are actually a similar grape called Savagnin from France so the majority of Albarino wine from Australia is actually Savagnin.</span></p>

The DO regions were established in 1932. The ancient Romans founded Carae in 50 B.C. where the locals were originally producing mead since the 3rd century. The climate of the region is very extreme. Extreme summer heat and cold hail storms cause many problems for grape growers. The northerly winds benefit the crop by keeping the humidity low. It is said that the varietal Carignan originated from this region and is used mostly in blended wines. The Carignan varietal has been known to produce high yields even with the high sensitivity to mildew and rot. Difficult to harvest, these grapes are often used to add deep coloring to a blend. A majority of the vineyards are relatively high in altitude and scattered along the plains of the Ebo river. Due to changes in the market, Carinena rearranged their wine production by experimenting with international varietals such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. Full bodied with good acidity, these grapes are great for Cuvees. They age well and develop complexity and harmony over time. During the middle ages Monks picked up Carinena&rsquo;s winemaking techniques and expanded the area for cultivation. Carinena&rsquo;s wines are known for their quality throughout Spain and in September there is a festival where the town&rsquo;s central fountain dispensed wine instead of water which originated from the 1585 visit of King Philip the 2nd. Carinena lies about 30 miles southwest of Zaragosa and the soil conditions vary. The region is located in the province of Zaragoza and covers an area of 16,600 hectares. The region produces 72.6 million liters of wine annually. Carinena, the grape is not the dominate varietal of the region and comes in second to Garnacha. This region was one of the most popular of the Aragon D.</p>

These grapes are primarily grown in the southern most part of the country in the regions known as Campania and Sicily. Fiano is a strong flavored grape with a long history behind it. Legends believe it to be the same grape that the Romans made Apianum from and you may even see the name turn up on some wine labels of Fiano di Avellino. The unfortunate part about Fiano grapes is that they produce low yields despite its strong flavor. The thick skinned and small grapes give off little juice which is why it isn&rsquo;t more prevalently grown. The status of DOCG was given to the region for Fiano based wines around Avellino. The most popular of wines to carry this grape is Fiano di Avellino in which 85% of Fiano grapes must be used to make the wine. The Roman name Apianum may be added to the label to show the historical value on this varietal. Although the grapes are grown mostly in Campania and Sicily, other regions are starting to grow Fiano, like Mclaren Vale, Australia. The wines produced from these grapes are very aromatic with notes of honey that develop in time and become spicier and nutty flavored. Modern wine making techniques have improved quality and freshness but some producers like to stick to traditional techniques.</p>

The name first appeared around 1855 and was finally established as the standard name in the 1930&rsquo;s. Before establishing its name, it was called by Gruner Muskateller and Weibgipfler. DNA tests have confirmed Traminer as being one of the parent varietals of Gruner. Like Riesling, Gruner adapts easily to many different soil types. This wine is very good with all different types of foods. It enhances and goes with just about everything. Gruner possesses a very pleasant citrus and grapefruit aroma with spices of ground white pepper. In Austria it is tradition to drink with food and to drink as early as possible even though these wines have the ability to age well. Once primarily grown in Czech Republic, Austria and Slovak Republic, Gruner Veltliner is grown in the U.S., New Zealand, and a few other areas as well.</p>

This white wine grape sometimes becomes unstable and mutates and bears black fruit. This full bodied white wine is largely grown in Alsace, France where it is used in both sparkling and still white wines. Pinot Blanc was originally blended in Champagnes and Burgundy wines. Pinot Blanc goes by many different names depending on the region. Some of the other names it is known by are Weissburgunder, Feher Burgundi, Pinot Blanco and Rulandske Bile. Some of the winemakers in the U.S. use similar techniques to those used to make Chardonnay which include malolactic fermentation and stored in new oak. Pinot Blanc pairs well with poultry, some seafood, light medium sauces and mild cheese. Many of the wines that are labeled Pinot Blanc are not 100% pure Pinot Blanc and are actually a blend of Auxerrois or Pinot Gris. Most of the full bodied Pinot Blanc wines from the region of Alsace have some Auxerrois grapes and posses a smokey and more persistent acidity.</p>

This grape ripens very slowly and is added to other wines mostly to add tannins, flavor and color to blends. The origins of Petit Verdot are a mystery but this varietal predates Cabernet Sauvignon in Bordeaux. In France, Petit Verdot is found in the Medoc area where it is added to give structure to classic Bordeaux. The name Petit Verdot means &ldquo;small green&rdquo; which becomes problematic because the berries sometimes don&rsquo;t develop properly without the right weather during flowering. This traditional black grape is used to add spice, dark color and powerful heavy tannins. Small batches of Petit Verdot are planted due to late ripening and short seasons make it difficult for a successful harvest. The characteristics of Petit Verdot are deep, purple color, with flavors of violet and leather. 2004 and 2006 were considered excellent years for Petit Verdot. This wine is best paired with red meats, and aged cheeses as well as big bold flavored foods.</p>

All these names are interchangeable and are grown mostly in California, Australia, Israel and France. In California, 90% of the Durif grapes are labeled &ldquo;Petite Sirah&rdquo;. It is a spicy, plumy flavored and tannic wine. The name Durif comes from a botanist named Francois Durif in 1880. The top leading producers of Durif are Australia and California. Produced as a varietal but sometimes found blended with Zinfandel and during times when Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir had low yields of production, Petite Sirah would be used to blend and strengthen the wine. Petite Syrah, not to be mistaken with Petite Sirah actually refers to a small yield of the Syrah grape. In 1978 Syrah was introduced in California and &ldquo;Petite Syrah&rdquo; was referred to a small berry clone of the Syrah grape. The wine is dark, inky and very tannic. The bouquet has a pepper over tones and very acidic. This wine is actually darker than Syrah and offers brightness with great aging ability. The wine is actually very rewarding if cellared for a long time. There is a certain mystery when it comes to the exact origins of this grape. There is a difficulty in growing these grapes due to them clustering together which can make them easily susceptible to rot. If you like a full bodied, black, inky wine, this is the wine for you.</p>

Trebbiano grapes were soon noted by the Romans, and now they accounts for approximately third of all white wine in Italy. In fact, it is very rare to find a white wine that isn&rsquo;t blended with Trebbiano grapes. Due to its neutral flavoring profile, several red wines produced in Italy are blended with Trebbiano grapes as well. They grow very well across Tuscany and elsewhere in central Italy, and spread its commonality to France. In France, Trebbiano grapes are known as Saint Emilion and Ugni Blanc. Because of the high yields and mild if not undistinguishable flavoring compare to other grape varieties, Trebbiano quickly spread to other regions of the world where there are sun-drenched hills that are hot during the day and cool at night. For example, in Bulgaria and Portugal, Trebbiano grapes are known as Thalia, and in Australia, they are called white hermitage. White wines made from Trebbiano grapes are dry with clean fruit and a faint of bitter finish. They are high in acidity which makes them important in Cognac production. Trebbiano white wines have medium alcohol content. These profiling makes Trebbiano white wines a perfect match for any seafood, salads, white meats, and light appetizers. It is best to drink Trebbiano white wines while they are young, for they do not age well.</p>

Cortese can now be found with the DOCG wine Cortese di Gavi. Long favored by restaurants in Genoa, this wine pairs well with the delicate flavors of fish, salads, and light dishes. These grapes grow well in the hills and goes by other names such as: Cortese di Gavi.</p>
<p>The fragrances are steely and dry on the palate and can develop intense richness with medium aging. Cortese is considered the jewel in the crown for Piedmont. Gavi was the first white wine to rank in the top of Italian white wines. A spumante version is also made and pairs well with seafood and light dishes. Wine that has Gavi on their label must contain grapes from the township of Gavi. Cortese is believed to be native to Alessandria. It is fragile and ripens early but if maintained, can produce great wine. Drinks well young and has an intense straw color with delicate aroma and a dry harmonious palate. Tutidi Cortese is a good white wine that contains the Cortese grapes.</p>

Used in wine, raisins, and table grapes, Muscat possesses a sweet floral aroma. Grown around the world, these grapes have a number of varieties. In Chile, the Muscat grapes are used in table wines and their edible grape qualities make them very recognizable. In Italy and California you can find these grapes in many sparkling wines like Muscato d&rsquo;Asti and light sparkling frizzante. Moscato Bianco is found in the Piedmont region of Italy. Muscat grapes make very sweet dessert wines although Muscato is not classified as a dessert wine. Some of the wines from Portugal and Spain are called Muscatels. This varietal is also the base for the piquor Pisco, as well and are used in Sherries and Malagas. Muscatel can be found almost everywhere. From the Finger Lakes, Oregon, Texas as well as the rest of the world, Muscatel is used in many different wines. There are very high concentrations of flavonoids and antioxidants in these grapes and are considered very healthy. Orange Muscat is a white grape variety which tends to be dry and although the name orange would suggest an aroma of oranges and that the wine will always be sweet, it is quite misleading. It is uncertain if Orange Muscat is a relative to other Muscat grape varieties. These wines pair well with soft cheese, some desserts and lighter dishes of seafood.</p>

In France Mourvedre sometimes goes by the name Balzac and is known to be in many Chateanueuf du Pape. This grape produces very powerful red wine and was one of the first to be used in Southern California. This late ripening grape suffered from the phylloxera epidemic but made a comeback and has risen in popularity. Many people believed that this grape was the same as Monastrell but DNA test concluded that they are separate grapes. In Spain they still call this grape Mataro or Monastrell. Frequently blended with Grenache, and Shiraz, Mourvedre adds color and spice to the blend. The flavors are sometimes described as gamey, spicy, and very tannic. Mourvedre has aromas of thyme, clove, cinnamon and black pepper. Due to the grapes bunching together, it thrives better in warmer weather and is susceptible to bunch rot without good ventilation. They pair well with rustic like meats, stews and roasts. This grape varietal is also found in Australia in the Barossa, and Mclaren Vale regions. Mourvedre almost came to apoint of extinction but survived and has gained new ground in Spain, France, Austrailia, U.S., and South Africa.</p>

Believed to originate from ancient times from the area of Greece where it was possibly named after a fortress named Monemvasia, a trading port for wine in the 17th century. The prolific trading of Malvasia wine led to the merchant wine trading shops being called Malvasie. There are other theories that the varietal has gained its name from a district of Malevizi near the city of Heraklion on Crete. Malvasia is used in the making of Champagne as well as dessert wines.

Calabria located in the Southern toe part of Italy cultivated by the Greeks. The majority of wine produced in the region is red wine with most of it from the Gaglioppo grape. The wine is full bodied and high in alcohol and is mostly blended with white wine due to the tannins which need time to soften. The grapes ripen late and DNA tests have revealed that it is a close relative of Sangiovese and a few other varietals. The origin of this grape is still shadowed in mystery. Some believe the Greeks brought it to Southern Italy to celebrate the Olympic Games and others believe it was native to the region. Although debatable, the wines from the region are definitely worth paying attention to. A popular region known as Ciro produces mostly red wines that contain at least 95% of the Gaglioppo grape. The wines are known to be tannic and full bodied with a strong presence of fruit. These wines should be consumed 3-4 years after the vintage.</p>

This wine follows a traditional way that has been carried on for centuries. Cava is created the same way Champagne is produced. They are usually aged a minimum of 2 years before being released. The Northwest region of Penedes produces almost all of the Cava for the rest of the country. The grapes used for Cava are parellada, xarello, and Macabeo. The characteristics of Cava are light, fruity, perfumed and sparkling. Cava producers are usually defined by their region and so are able to put Cava on their labels under the DOC (denomination of origin.) Cava shares the same characteristics as Champagne and the only reason they cannot label their sparkling wine Champagne is because it is not from that area of France. Some Cava winemakers maximize their crops to keep costs down. Some Cava wines are Segura Viudas brut Reserva, Cristalino, and Freixenet. Freixenet is one of the most popular sparkling wines in the United States. They also make a red Cava that uses Monastrell and red Garnacha grapes. Cava is an acceptable alternative to champagne but it is actually cheaper. Cava comes in many different styles. These are Brut Nature, Extra Brut, Brut, Extra seco, Seco, Semi seco, Dulce. Each varies in sweetness and does not age. It actually deteriorates with age so drink it shortly after you purchase it.</p>

Mainly Southern Italy specializes in this unique refreshing drink. This Liqueur is made from Sorrento lemon peels although I think any lemon will work just as well. Limoncello are best served chilled and usually after a meal. Italians traditionally served this drink as a digestivo which aided digestion. The taste is unique given a strong lemon taste without being sour or bitter. This drink has become increasingly popular all throughout the world. Many prefer to make their own homemade Limoncello but it can be tricky so it is sometimes easy just to purchase at your local wine store. If made at home, it is best to use organic lemons because you use the skin of the lemon and with Organic lemons there are no pesticides or waxing coating on them like regular lemons. Microplane the lemons and avoid the white part below the zest because it will add bitterness to your drink. Next add 100 proof mid grade vodka, and then store it in a tight glass jar in a cool area. Wait a minimum of 40 days to ensure the lemon flavors are absorbed into your drink. Now add some simple sugar mixture which is basically water and sugar, once cooled add to the vodka lemon mixture and store again for about 20 days (the longer it is stored, the smoother it will be). Last step is to filter your mixture well until it has the clarity of Limoncello and chill, then put your feet up and enjoy all the work you did to make the perfect Limoncello.</p>

The Japanese term for this specific beverage is </span><span>Nihonshu</span><span>, meaning ""</span><span>Japanese sake</span><span>"".</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Sake is also referred to in English as a form of rice wine. However, unlike true wine, in which alcohol is produced by fermenting the sugar naturally present in fruit, sake is made through a brewing process more like that of beer. To make beer or sake, the sugar needed to produce alcohol must first be converted from starch. However, the brewing process for sake differs from beer brewing as well, notably in that for beer, the conversion of starch to sugar and sugar to alcohol occurs in two discrete steps, but with sake they occur simultaneously. Additionally, alcohol content also differs between sake, wine, and beer. Wine generally contains 9&ndash;16% alcohol and most beer is 3&ndash;9%, whereas undiluted sake is 18&ndash;20% alcohol, although this is often lowered to around 15% by diluting the sake with water prior to bottling.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The rice used for brewing sake is called </span><span>shuzo kotekimai</span><span>&nbsp;(sake rice). The grain is larger, stronger, and contains less protein and lipid than the ordinary rice eaten by Japanese. The rice has a starch component called </span><span>shinpaku</span><span>&nbsp;in the center of the grains. Since sake made from rice containing purely starch has a superior taste, the rice is polished to remove the bran. If a grain is small or weak, it will break in the process of polishing. This rice is only used for making sake because it is unpalatable for eating. There are at least 80 types of sake rice in Japan. Among these, Yamadanishiki, Gohyakumangoku, Miyamanishiki and Omachi rice are very popular.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The taste of Sake depends on achieving a balance between sweetness and acidity, a balance that can be maintained only through the combination of proper water, malt, yeast and steamed rice. This balance cannot be assured by technology, but only with the experience of skilled artisans who have special insight into the subtleties of minute changes in climate, rice and water. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Sake making is distinguished from other brewing methods by its use of a process called ""multiple parallel fermentation"". In making an alcoholic beverage from grains, it is necessary to convert grain starch into sugar, and then convert the sugar into alcohol by means of yeast. Sake brewing combines these two steps by a simultaneous conversion that results in Sake having an 18% higher alcohol content than any other fermented drink.</span></p>

After becoming popular in England by John Woodhouse, Marsala wine was mass produced and proved very successful. &nbsp;The process to make this wonderful wine is called in perpetuum which is similar to how they make sherry and their solera system. The grapes used to make this wine are Inzolia, Catarratto and Grillo which are white grape varietals. &nbsp;Originally Marsala was served in between meals as an aperitif usually chilled with cheese but Marsala is also very frequently used in cooking. This wine is used in a variety of recipes from chicken marsala to tiramisu and risotto. There are several different types of Marsala, they are: </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Fine- aged about a year in oak and suitable for cooking.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Superiore- aged about two years to three years in oak.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Superiore Reserva- aged about 4 years in oak and very good for serving as an aperitif.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Vergine Soleras- aged about 5 years in oak and is a blend of different vintages.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Being a fortified wine, Marsala is a very long lasting wine that doesn&rsquo;t need to be stored in the refrigerator. Just keep it in a cool dark place and it should last many months. I suggest consuming it within three to four months because the flavors slowly deteriorate. This is a great wine to pair with olives, soft cheeses, smoked meats and some chocolate desserts.</span></p>

Chachca is mostly from Brazil and conatins about 35% to 54% alcohol. &nbsp;Sometimes made at home and made as strong as one wants, Cachaca has a lot of sugar in it. Often confused with being rum, Cachaca is actually different. The differences between a Rum and Cachaca is that Rum is made from molasses which is a by product of the crystallization process where as Cachaca is made from pure sugar cane juice that is fermented and distilled. Cachaca goes by many creative names given to it by the Brazilian people because at one time this beverage was banned in Brazil due to competition with European Grapa, that they named it different names to deceive the supervision of this ban. &nbsp;Some say there are over 700 names for this liquor. One of the drinks made with Cachaca is called Caipirinha which is Brazil&rsquo;s national cocktail. Enjoyed in bars, restaurants and clubs, Caipirinha translates to Caipira which mean someone from the countryside. Similar to being a hillbilly, Caipirinha is a delicious drink made with simple ingredients.</span></p>

The flavor of Grappa can depend on the distillation and the quality of the grapes used to make this drink. &nbsp;The process of making Grappa is by distilling the skins, pulp, stems and seeds that are left over from the pressing of grapes from wine-making which originally was intended to prevent the waste left over. &nbsp;There have been rules and regulations set up to protect Grappa. Some of these guidelines consist of: Originating form Italy, must be produced from pumice, and no water must be added with the same method used to produce brandy. &nbsp;Grappa is served as an after dinner drink to aide with digestion after heavy meals. It may also be added to coffee or chased after espresso. Most Grappa is clear although some may have a faint pigment from the pumice. One way to see if a Grappa is well made is by rubbing a small amount on the back of the hand and if the aroma is a pleasant one, the Grappa is well made. &nbsp;Grappa is served chilled in a small glass and served after a meal, first swirl in the glass and enjoy the aroma before tasting.</span></p>

Spain has imposed many restrictions on wine making and commerce but it didn&rsquo;t stop the advancement of the liqueur and wine industry which developed pretty fast. &nbsp;The town of Pisco is located in Peru along the coast. The name can actually be traced back to a language called Quechua where the name refers to a bird that inhabited the area was called Pisqu. The history dates back to Pre-Incan where the people were called Piskus. &nbsp;Mostly consumed locally, Pisco became increasingly popular among sailors and officers who referred to this drink as Pisco thinking it was named after the Port it came from. The low price and readily availability made it the drink of choice on Ocean going vessels until Rum knocked it out of popularity. &nbsp;In 1864 Pisco was native only to Peru and spread to Chile shortly after. Some of the more commonly known drinks made with Pisco are Pisco Sours, Pisco Punch, Serena Libre, etc.</span></span></p>

An acquired taste is needed for Sherries and no other wine in the world is made like a sherry. &nbsp;There are many different types and styles that have been produced since the 1600&rsquo;s. The vast history of sherry is very interesting. Sherry comes from southern Spain and is fortified with Brandy. It was created when the Moors conquered the region of Spain and introduced distillation. &nbsp;During these times the area was known as Sherish (derived from Arabic). Sherry has a longer shelf life than other wines and was carried on many voyages from Christopher Columbus to Ferdinand Magellan. Sherry is made with the Solera system in which newer vintages are mixed with older vintages which results in high quality wine that share some of the original vintage of that estate. &nbsp;This is one of the reasons why you never see a vintage on a Sherry.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are a wide range of Sherries which range from dry to sweet. &nbsp;Some of the different types include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Fino</span><span>- Fino is traditionally the palest and driest of the varieties. Aged under Flor yeast to prevent oxygen contact.</span></li>
<li><span>Amontillado</span><span>- This is Darker than fino and is usually dry although sometimes sold lightly sweetened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Oloroso</span><span>- Oloroso is darker and means &ldquo;scented&rdquo; in Spanish.This is a rich wine with a lot of alcohol in it.</span></li>
<li><span>Manzanilla</span><span>- This type of sherry is a lighter version of Fino.</span></li>
<li><span>Manzanilla Pasada</span><span>- This is a version of Mazanilla that has been aged and exposed to oxygen which gives it a nice flavorful nutty taste.</span></li>
<li><span>Palo Cortado</span><span>- These sherries are aged over three years.</span></li>
<li><span>Cream Sherries</span><span>- Cream or sweet sherries are made with Moscatel grapes which give it sweetness &nbsp;and are mixed with a drier wine.</span></li>

The alcohol content can be a bit high around 15% and that makes for the wines late release which is usually five years after the vintage.</span></span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-d4417c6f-7fff-1555-bf55-03be9512a003""><span>The process of making Amarone is very laborious which gives value to the wine. Amarone is loved by many and is considered one of Italy&rsquo;s treasures. The name is easy to pronounce and is usually produced in the area of Veneto. &nbsp;Amarone comes from the word amaro which in Italian means &ldquo;bitter&rdquo;. Some say that the first Amarone made was a mistake by a winemaker who left the wine to ferment too long. Amarone della Valpolicella, and Recioto della Valpolicella are both wines made in that region. &nbsp;Amarone wines are robust and go well with some games and hearty meats. They are full bodied with aromas of cherries, plum, spice, licorice, cocoa and vanilla. The grapes go through a drying process before being pressed. Amarones are more expensive than other wines because it takes more grapes and there is more labor involved during production.</span></span></p>

<p>The next time you are in the wine store, take a look around and see how many bottles have screw tops. Many surveys and wine connoisseurs prefer to have a cork over a screw cap and there is still a debate on what&rsquo;s better. &nbsp;Many question how good a wine can be with a screw cap and usually avoid purchasing it but the truth behind screw caps could actually change your mind. There are three ways to close your bottle of wine. One way is cork, the second way is plastic cork and the third is a &nbsp;&nbsp;screw cap. Let us compare all three and you can make a decision after reading the facts.</p>
<p>Natural cork stoppers have been around since the beginning. &nbsp;Corks are made naturally from trees. It&rsquo;s the tissue between the bark and the phloem of a tree. &nbsp;Mostly produced in Portugal from the Quercus Suber or otherwise known as the Cork Oak tree, this type provides many agricultural jobs. &nbsp;There are a few downsides to the cork. I know many times I have tried to open a bottle of wine and some of the cork broke off into the wine making it quite awkward and hard to enjoy the wine. &nbsp;Another bad problem is with today&rsquo;s security issues which is prohibiting people from carrying a cork screw on an airplane. Corks have also been known to sometimes spoil the wine in a process known as &ldquo;corked&rdquo;.<img height=""122"" src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/h06ge8eNnqi80T7JClQZUO1FreWMMc2MxynyOMUq0N-2Fn3NVlR7IYs8X5kS-4H77bhEG0zblMExFYzyOud-fHC-KkaSI71YVOoryOCwPUH6HjGwUclURj5g9vmkc7_B"" style=""float: left;"" width=""131"" /></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>You will know if a wine is corked from the smell and taste. &nbsp;It will have a flat musty smell and taste which is from a chemical known as TCA (Trichloroanisole) which is used to treat and sanitize the cork before bottling. &nbsp;There is an estimated 3-9% of wines on the shelf are corked. The decline in cork production could cause dire consequences to economic and ecosystems around the world. &nbsp;The European cork industry employs over 30,000 employees and produces 300,000 tons of cork a year.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Other alternatives are &nbsp;plastic stoppers or synthetic corks. A viable alternative to the natural cork,it is very cheap in manufacturing costs as compared to the natural cork. One good benefit of the synthetic corks is that they can be recycled. &nbsp;First appearing around 1993, many thought that they would take over the market as the new wine stopper. The bad side to synthetic corks is that they lose their elasticity and allow for oxidation of the wine decreasing shelf life. &nbsp;They are usually used for wines that are to be consumed within 5 years. Many studies also stated that synthetic corks leave a bigger carbon footprint than natural and twist off caps. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The third alternative is the twist off cap. &nbsp;Although it isn&rsquo;t very appealing, screw tops provide the best seal for bottled wines. &nbsp;There are no oxidation problems and it also eliminates the corked problem with natural corks. &nbsp;&nbsp;A study from Hogue Cellars showed that the Stelvin screw caps used kept the bottle of wine fresh and flavorful.

<p dir=""ltr""><span>I was surprised like many of you will be to find that screw caps are better. &nbsp;I think many people will always be bias against screw caps because the experience of opening the bottle is lost. &nbsp;The romance and the enjoyment of hearing that cork pop builds for a better memories. I do know that more and more vineyards are turning to the screw cap so don&rsquo;t be shocked if you see your favorite bottle of wine with a screw cap.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

Produced in Portugal since the mid 15th Century, Port gained popularity in England after the Methuen Treaty of 1703. While this treaty did war-related things reserved for history books, in regards to wine it caused England to become an adopted family for Port, with Portugal being the biological parents.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>According to Portugal's Port Wine Institute, Americans are sixth in worldwide consumption of all port, with 4.4 percent of the market and 402,000 cases a year. In first place -- ironically, given that they were indirectly responsible for the English infatuation with port -- are the French, with 33 percent of the market (just over 3 million cases, much of it consisting of white port and young tawnies, which the French regard as perfect aperitifs), almost three times as much as the British, followed by the Dutch at 20 percent and, in third place, the British with 12 percent. In the high-end, premium port market, ranging from reserve to vintage, Britain is the No. 1 importing nation with 27 percent of the world market (191,500 cases),followed by the United States with 18 percent (128,000 cases), Canada with 16 percent and France with 13 percent.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Port is a naturally sweet, fortified red wine which achieves its sweetness by adding brandy to the fermenting grape juice thus stopping fermentation before all of the grape sugar has been converted to alcohol. Port wines are blessed with a full, fruity flavor, and possess a powerful perfumed, flowery aroma that defies description. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>There are different types of port wines:</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Vintage Port </span><span>is made only in those years when the grapes achieve near total perfection and receive no processing other than two years of barrel aging. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>L</span><span>ate Bottled Vintage Port (LBV) </span><span>is made of grapes from a single, but excellent year, and held in barrels for four to six years.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Tawny Port </span><span>is a blend that has been kept in barrels eight to twenty years to mellow and develop the velvet texture and rich flavor that has made this style famous. Because of a longer time in the wood, the color becomes lighter and browner than the other styles. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Ruby Port </span><span>is kept for several years in the aging tanks to marry and mature before bottling. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>White Port </span><span>Not very common, but some Port is made as </span><span>White Port</span><span>. It can be designated Reserve or have an indication of age (10, 20, 30, or 40 years) as long as Port wine regulations are met. It can range from dry to very sweet.</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>How to serve port wine</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Nothing warms up a cold winter day like a glass of Port. Great at the end of a meal, perfect with a bowl of candied walnuts. Port is also an excellent partner to a quality cigar. Best served slightly cooler than room temperature in small quantities in a small- to medium-sized Port glass.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Port should be served around 65 degrees, in a narrow wine glass, and the glass should only be half filled. This keeps the alcohol content from overwhelming the flavors. It often needs to be decanted, and is traditionally served with Stilton or Cheddar cheese, and goes very well with chocolate. Port aromas include pepper, smoke, truffles and black currant. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The rich, full-bodied types of Porto are usually drunk after a meal, but the lighter Tawny and White varieties are highly appreciated as an ap&eacute;ritif before a meal. Nuts and cheeses, or pies and cakes are a good choice to accompany Porto, or even melon, depending on the mood of the party. </span></p>

These vines are less likely to be affected by Botrytis cinera or otherwise known as noble rot. &nbsp;When the grapes freeze before fermentation the water in the grape freezes which allows all the sugars to gather and so you produce a smaller amount of wine but very sweet. &nbsp;The clean refreshing high acidity grapes can be quite expensive due to the long labor intensive process of production. Some of the world&rsquo;s best Ice Wines come from Canada and Germany. &nbsp;The history of Icewines can date back to Roman Times although the process of making the wine was unclear. The first documentation of making Icewine came later on in the year 1794 in Germany. &nbsp;Some say the winter was so harsh that some of the wine growers left the grapes on the vines for the animals but once they noticed the grapes were very sweet they pressed it to create Icewine. Some of the most valuable and expensive Icewines are from late harvested grapes. &nbsp;As far as the Icewines in Canada, the history states that Karl Kaiser from the inniskillin winery produced the first Canadian Icewines in 1984. There are many complications when trying to produce an Icewine. Some problems include having to keep the grapes on the vines until the frost season comes which can be problematic because the animals and birds may eat the crops. &nbsp;Natural Icewines occur after the grapes are ripe and between a certain temperature. If the grapes freeze too much the juice cannot be extracted and if the frost doesn&rsquo;t come soon enough then the grapes could rot. The grapes must be harvested at night or very early morning under harsh conditions which is one reason that Icewines are very expensive. These wines are often found sold in half size bottles ranging from 375ml to 200ml and sometimes in gift sets due to the small quantities the harvest yields.</span></span></p>

The initial wine making process is just like any other wines. &nbsp;The grapes are harvested, crushed, pressed then fermented in either stainless steel or oak casks. Afterwards, it is heated up to 140oF/60oC for an extended period of time as well as deliberately exposing the wine to some levels of oxidation. &nbsp;This process is called Estufagem. It is type of aging process that is meant to duplicate the root of Madeira wines which dates back to the Age of Exploration when Madeira was a regular port of call for ships travelling the New World and East Indies. Estufagem replicates the effect of a long sea voyage of aging barrel through tropical climates. &nbsp;Because of this process, it is a very robust wine. Also, it is capable of maintaining its characteristics even after being opened. In fact, it can be opened up to a year. A properly sealed bottle can last a very long time. Madeira wines are one of the longest lasting wines. Some are known to survive over 150 years in excellent condition. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are four major types of Madeira. &nbsp;They are named according to the grape variety used: </span></p>

</ul>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Malmsey/Malvasia</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It is dark colored, rich textured with coffee and caramel flavors. &nbsp;A malmsey Madeira is the richest, most full-bodied Madeira style. It makes a perfect dessert wine. &nbsp;It also goes well with desserts like cheesecake, tiramisu or dark chocolate-based desserts. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Here are some malmsey wines: &nbsp;</span></p>

</ul>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As far as the cheaper priced Madeira wines, they are often flavored with salt and pepper for use in cooking. &nbsp;Because it is mostly used for cooking, the cheaper versions are fermented completely regardless of the grape variety and fortified so as not to lose any alcohol to evaporation. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Sweet wines like malmsey and Bual are often fermented on their skins while the dry wines like verdelho and sercial are fermented without their skins. &nbsp;The wine labeled &ldquo;finest&rdquo; means that it has been aged for at least three years. This is usually reserved for cooking. Other labels like reserve means five years, special reserve means ten years and extra reserve means fifteen years. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The top of Madeira wines are labeled vintage which is aged at least twenty years and another two years in bottle. &nbsp;Madeira with Colheira labels mean vintage that is less than twenty years. They are good wines with much more individuality than a blend, but some of them lack the concentration of a real vintage. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Madeira wines are considered &ldquo;out of style&rdquo; but the fascination for some people still remains. </span></p>

Some of these wines can be very expensive. It was the Dutch traders of the 17</span><span>th</span><span> century who showed interest in white wines. &nbsp;They also introduced German white wine techniques that halted fermentation and kept the residual sugars high. &nbsp;The wine from this area was known as Vins Liquoreux. By the end of the 18</span><span>th</span><span> century, the practice of using nobly rotted grapes in Tokaji and Germany was well known but prior to that, it was kept a hidden secret. &nbsp;Even American President Thomas Jefferson was a fan of Sauternes. The Sauterne region is located southeast of Bordeaux along the Garonne River. &nbsp;There are five regions that make up the Sauterne wine region. Barsac, Fargues, Bommes, Preignac and Sauternes are the regions that make up Sauterne. &nbsp;The Barsac region is also able to label their wines under the Barsac appellation and their wines are drier and lighter in body. The Botrytis fungus or noble rot has a unique effect that alters the grapes to retain a high sugar level while still having a high acidity needed to balance the wine to keep it from being too sweet. &nbsp;Sauternes are a balance of acidity and sweetness with flavors of apricots, honey and peaches with long finishes. Sauternes are capable of aging for a very long time. Best served chilled and enjoyed with desserts. </span></p>

The grapes used in this wine are affected by noble rot which makes them sweet. &nbsp;There is such a long history associated with Takaji that it is even mentioned in Hungarys national anthem. Since 2007 only wine producers from that region of Hungary are allowed to use the name and all other wines from other areas are not authorized or permitted use of the name. &nbsp;Even Slovakia can only use the label if they produce the wine under Hungarian regulations. There are only 6 grape varieties used in this wine production. Furmint, Harslevelu, Yellow Muscat, Zeta, Koverzolo, and Kabar are the 6 varietals used in Tokaji wine. The soil of the area is very volcanic and has high concentrations of iron and limestone. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Early rains, cool springs, bitter winters and extended Indian summers are common climate conditions which make for longer ripening periods and tons of concentrated sugars in the grapes. The Furmint grapes start out with thick skins but tend to thin as they ripen which allows the sun to evaporate the liquid and concentrate the sugars. Unlike other grapes, Furmint grapes will grow a second skin and seal it from rot. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Small production and low yields make this wine have higher costs. The history as far as we know dates back to 1576 when it was mentioned in the Nomenklatura of Fabricius Balazs Sziksai and Tokaji wine became the first appellation controlled wine decades before Port wine and over 120 year before Bordeaux. The treaty of Trianon split the region up and part became Czechoslovakian and the other half became Hungary.</span></p>

There are a wide variety of liqueurs with all types of mixtures. &nbsp;Some may confuse this term with Cre&rsquo;me liqueur which contain no cream in their mixture. &nbsp;Cre&rsquo;me stands for the consistency and the sugar added which make them syrupy. Some of the different Cream Liqueurs out there are Bailey&rsquo;s Irish cream, Kahlua, Amarula, etc. &nbsp;These cream liqueurs can have many different ingredients like Cr&egrave;me de la Cr&egrave;me which uses maple syrup and cream from Canada, Dooley&rsquo;s which uses toffee and vodka and Tequila Rose which is tequila and strawberry cream. &nbsp;Any liqueur that is creamy in texture and uses some dairy in their mixture is considered a cream liqueur. Many of these drinks have great shelf life due to the volume of alcohol in them which acts like a preservative. I know Baileys Irish cream can last up to 30 months and contains no preservatives. &nbsp;Some can be enjoyed with ice or chilled and great to just sip straight although many use these cream liqueurs in mix drinks like white Russians, etc.</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>I have opened up a bottle of Rosenblum Harris Kratka Zinfandel 2006 the other day and was impressed with the wine. &nbsp;When first opened, it had aromas of blackberry jam, licorice, and plum. This wine was soft velvety with elegance and power. Layered spices with deep fruit with juicy flavors. &nbsp;The long finish showed the solid tannins. Great to enjoy with rosemary grilled meats and BBQ Salmon. This bottle will of course evolve more but currently the layered spices and great aroma make this a great pick.</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>A little History about the Vineyard</span></h2>

The winery has continued to gain the respect and appreciation of both the public and its peers, and has been honored with numerous gold medals and 90-plus scores.

<p dir=""ltr""><span>2007 was an excellent year for the Rhone region. &nbsp;Both Northern and Southern Rhone produced highly acclaimed wines in 2007. &nbsp;Robert Parker said &ldquo;It was a truly historic and profoundly good vintage. It may be the most compelling vintage of any viticultural region I have ever tasted.&rdquo; The Wine Advocate rated the 2007 vintage year a 98E. The Wine Spectator also rated the vintage a high 95 Points stating &ldquo;Ripe, rich, powerful reds thanks to long Indian summer at harvest time. Grenache is heady and rich, so Mourvedre and Cinsault are key for balance. The best wines are classic hedonistic delights, though some are over the top. Below are some excellent varieties of wine from the Rhone appellations 2007 Vintage.</span></p>
<h1 dir=""ltr""><span>Domaine de Fondreche ""Persia"" Cotes du Ventoux 2007 750ml</span></h1>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>92 Points - Wine Advocate ""Two late-release 2007s that have just hit the market are brilliant wines, among the best I have ever tasted from the cool-climate, high-elevation vineyard of Domaine de Fondreche. The 100% Syrah cuvee, the 2007 Persia (red) exhibits wonderful bacon fat, roasted meat, smoked herbs, incense, and plenty of blackberry and cassis fruit. Dense, chewy, full-bodied, but lush, with silky tannins and good acidity, this brilliant wine should drink well for 5-6 years as well. Both of these wines actually showed even better this year than they did last year. One of the consistently superb estates in the Cotes du Ventoux, Domaine de Fondreche offer very high quality and reasonable prices. The creation of Sebastian Vincenti and Manou Barthelemy, these wines are bursting with fruit and have loads of minerality and aromatics. They are beautiful efforts representing the best of what a young generation of French producers can do. The estate is just under 100 acres in size and is now 100% biodynamically farmed. As Sebastian Vincenti told me, 2008 was a very strong vintage for the whites but presented many challenges with the reds"". -Wine Advocate # 185, Drink: 2009 - 2015 , Oct 2009 Robert Parker.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1 dir=""ltr""><span>Domaine De Montvac Vacqueyras 2007 750ml</span></h1>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Montvac&rsquo;s vines are a grouping of many different parcels with varying soils and microclimates ranging from terraces under the Dentelles de Montmirail to more traditional Chateauneuf terroir of galets roulets with limestone clay sub soils. The old vine bottlings of Vacqueyras Vincila and variation are the tete de cuvee offerings from this very talented and unique woman in the world of Rhone winemakers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1 dir=""ltr""><span>Les Cailloux Chateauneuf-Du-Pape Cuvee Centenaire 2007 750ml</span></h1>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>96 points - Wine Spectator ""Rich, but amazingly silky and elegant, this is layered with blackberry, raspberry and fig fruit and stitched with incense, black tea and warm plum sauce notes, all of it staying remarkably lithe and suave. The superlong finish shows weight and precision as only Grenache can. Tempting now, but should put on weight in the cellar. Drink now through 2030."" (11/09)&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1 dir=""ltr""><span> </span><span>Chateau De Beaucastel Chateauneuf-Du-Pape 2007 750ml</span></h1>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>96 Points - Wine Spectator ""Layers of melted fig, mulled boysenberry and black currant fruit are laced with notes of charred mesquite, hoisin sauce and coffee. The long, silky mouthfeel belies the latent power in reserve. Best from 2010 through 2030.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> 96 Points - International Wine Cellar ""Saturated ruby. Smoky aromas of black raspberry, cola, licorice, tar and dried flowers expand with air while maintaining focus. Extremely fresh, with energetic red and dark berry flavors strongly underscored by candied flowers and minerals. I kept waiting for tannins to come out but it didn't happen. Finishes lush and creamy, with lingering notes of red fruits and tobacco. The blend this year is 30% each of mourvedre and grenache, 10% each of syrah and counoise and the rest ""all the others.""</span></p>

For example, it is only possible to manufacture true </span><a href=""http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-champagne.htm""><span>Champagne</span></a><span>&nbsp;from the grapes that are grown in the Champagne region of France.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The same is true for Prosecco. Under European law, the name &ldquo;Prosecco&rdquo; can only be applied to wine that is made from Prosecco grapes grown in the Valdobbiadene / Conegliano region of Italy. Prosecco and </span><a href=""http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-dalmatian.htm""><span>Dalmatian</span></a><span>&nbsp;Prosek are not the same beverage, but very different ones. Dalmatian Prosecco is made from dried grapes, not fresh ones. Furthermore, it is an especially sweet wine akin to sherry.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Traditionally Prosecco was made as a soft, somewhat sweet wine with just a little fizz, but today's Proseccos are dry and very bubbly. Sometimes combined with a small amount of Pinot Blanc or Pinot Grigio grapes, Prosecco is made using the Charmat method rather than the Champagne method, the French method of making sparkling wine. The Charmat method allows the wine to go through the second fermentation in pressurized tanks rather than in individual bottles. No turning the bottles every day as in Champagne. The shorter tank fermentation is preferable for Prosecco because it preserves the freshness and flavor of the grapes.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Prosecco, Italy's famed sparkling wine, and the name of the white grape that is used to produce the bubbly itself. It hails from the Veneto region, in the northeast of the Italian boot and it's typically a fantastic value wine find - as versatile as it is economical. The dominate Prosecco producing towns are Valdobbiadene and Conegliano - buyer tip: look for these towns on the bottle label. Give up $10 and you will likely grab a Prosecco that offers delicate fruit and enticing aromatics, lots of bubbles (</span><span>spumante</span><span>) or lightly-bubbled (</span><span>frizzante</span><span>) and usually lies on the dry to off-dry side of the style spectrum.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Give up $15-20 and you'll turn the whole Prosecco experience into overdrive with more fruit vigor, more balance and loads of high-intensity aromatics. On the palate you can expect Prosecco to deliver ripe assorted apple, pear, some citrus and often a dash of nutty almond flavoring. DOC prosecco is produced in the regions of Friuli venezia Giulia &nbsp;and Veneto in Italy, and traditionally mainly in the areas near conegliano and valdobbiadene&nbsp;in the hills north of Treviso.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Prosecco is known as the main ingredient of the Bellini cocktail and has more recently become popular as a less expensive substitute for champagne.</span></p>

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Vineyard Notes:</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The wine&rsquo;s complex flavors come from four outstanding vineyards in Napa Valley and one in Knights Valley. Small-berried Cabernet Sauvignon from Rutherford and Knights Valley provides the wine&rsquo;s core, giving it deep berry notes and structure. Merlot from Sterling Vineyards Bear Flats Vineyard just south of the winery adds black cherry notes and heightened aromas, while Petit Verdot brushes the wine with a hint of violets. Petite Sirah, though technically of Rh&ocirc;ne rather than Bordeaux heritage, finishes the blend with its lush, spicy personality.</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>About the Winery:</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Perched 300 feet above the town of Calistoga, Sterling Vineyards offers panoramic views of Napa Valley. An aerial tram carries visitors up the hill to the winery, whose architecture was modeled after that of the Greek island of Mykonos, where Sterling founder Peter Newton once lived. The brilliant white stucco stands out dramatically against the rugged Mayacamas and Vaca mountain ranges that flank each side of Napa Valley. Mount Saint Helena makes a lovely distant backdrop. The winery&rsquo;s towers house eight bells from London&rsquo;s Church of St. Dunstans-in-the-East, originally founded in the 10th century. The church was destroyed by fire in 1666, rebuilt, then destroyed again during the bombing of WWII. Each time, new bells were recast from the old metal to give them superior tonal quality. The rich tolling of these ancient bells sounds down through the valley on the quarter hour. Walkways, balconies, and motion-sensitive DVD screens allow guests to take a self-guided tour of Sterling Vineyards&rsquo; wine making facilities. Beautiful outdoor terraces and elegant tasting rooms provide the perfect environment to enjoy exceptional wines while taking in the view. The extraordinary Mediterranean-style architecture, unique aerial tramway, stunning location, historic bells, and attention to visitors make Sterling Vineyards a top destination in the Napa Valley.</span></p>

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>A Little about the Winemaker:</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Gerard Bertrand quickly developed a wine business by selecting winemakers and estates that shared his sense of what was called for. &nbsp;In order to express his talent as a winemaker beyond his native appellation of the Corbieres, he chose to invest in other wines of Languedoc with strong potential. &nbsp;In 1994 he bought the Cigalus Vin de Pays d&rsquo;Oc parcels, then three years later the 58 hectares of Chateau Laville-Bertrou in Minervois La Liviniere. A forerunner in the Languedoc, Gerard Bertrand understood the evolution in consumer behavior towards expressive, well balanced and elegant wines. &nbsp;By offering great wines at fair prices his success was immediate. The prestige wines of Gerard Bertrand quickly became the quality reference in the opinion of the professionals. In the footsteps of his father, Gerard has been contributing to the epic story of the Languedoc in these past years; he is the payee of the qualitative changes made to a good number of Languedoc terroirs and estates.</span></p>

Mostly used for dry red wine, these grapes also are found in a sweet version of Lambrusco. &nbsp;The grapes are high in acidity and contain berry flavors. They have identified over 60 different clones of this varietal and Lambrusco can also produce a white and rose style of wines as well. &nbsp;The grapes originate in different regions of Italy. Some of these regions are Lombardy, Emilia Romagna, Modena, Parma, Mantua, and Reggio nell Emilia. Very popular in Italy and used as a table wine, there are stories of Lambrusco and how two thirds of an acre could produce 300 ceramic containers called amphoras. &nbsp;Lambrusco is very easy to drink.</span></span></p>

Gamay based wines are light bodied and fruity and best served with a little aging. This varietal is usually blended with Cabernet Franc and Cot. &nbsp;The grape is also found in Oregon, Australia, and the Niagara peninsula.

Other known region where the grape is found is Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Peru, in parts of the U.S. and Italy. &nbsp;Known for high tannin levels, Tannat is often blended with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Fer. The characteristics of the grape are firm, tannic with great aromas and had the ability to age well. &nbsp;The wine produced is usually a dark color with high levels of alcohol. In Italy in the Puglia region, this grape is commonly used as a blending grape. Other wines made from these grapes are Armagnac and full bodied Rose. &nbsp;Tannat wines from Uruguay are more elegant and softer. The newer clones of this vine are producing more powerful wines with higher alcohol levels. Dr. Roger Corder recently studied the effects of red wine on the cardiovascular system and concluded that red wines contain OPC&rsquo;s which are beneficial to heart health.</span></p>

It is a white grape varietal and used in blends and the principal component of the wines from Hermitage and sparkling wines. Outside of France this grape is found in Australia, Switzerland and the U.S. This varietal is delicate and needs the right climate to thrive in. In areas too hot, the grape over-ripens and in regions too cold, the grape doesn&rsquo;t ripen fully and tastes bland. The wines made from this varietal tend to be deeply colored with hints of spice and pear, rich and nutty. It can be high in alcohol and with proper aging can develop more body with darker color and flavors. Although the varietal Roussanne is allowed to be grown in the Chateauneuf du Pape region, Marsanne is not allowed. This varietal can also be found in many Cotes du Rhone wines. Some producers leave the grapes on the vine until the last possible moment to harvest for higher alcohol levels and better aging ability.</p>

It dates back to the first known mention of it in the 16th century. &nbsp;The name is derived from the French word meunier which means flour like dusty white down the underside of the leaves. Many believe this grape to be a mutation of Pinot Noir. &nbsp;This grape has been favored because it buds and ripens more reliably than Pinot Noir. It thrives in cooler climates and produces light colored wines with higher acid levels and contributes great aromatics and fruity flavors to wine which is why it is commonly used for Champagnes that are consumed young because it doesn&rsquo;t age as well as Chardonnay or Pinot Noir. &nbsp;Widely planted during the 19th century throughout France, it is also found in Germany, and California. In Germany, Pinot Meunier is used to make light, off dry, rich fruity wines known as Schillerwein and used in a sparkling wine called Sekt. </span></span></p>

It is called that because of the difficulty in growing this varietal which led to its decline and almost to extinction until 1980 where plantings of this grape saw an increase. &nbsp;The vines are prone to powdery mildew, though new clones of this vine are developing a tolerance. Winemakers discovered different soils gave the grapes different characteristics. Chalky, sandy soils gave the grapes more acidity while clay soils bring out the elegant and exotic perfumes. &nbsp;It produces a clean crisp and floral varietal that is dry with a full body and low acidity. Arneis is used to soften Nebbiolo and becomes more full bodied if aged in oak. Arneis has the potential to make highly perfumed wines with wonderful aromas of almonds, apricots and peaches. There are also limited plantings in Australia, California and New Zealand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

This white grape varietal Vernaccia translates to &ldquo;vernacular&rdquo;. The history of this grape can date back to ancient times and was commonly referred to as Vernage in London. The white varietal produces a good crisp wine with good acidity and citrus notes. It is both a varietal wine and blended with Trebbiano. Since the Renaissance, Vernaccia has been considered one of the finest white wines in Italy and the first to be awarded DOC status in 1966. That designation was later upgraded to DOCG in 1993. The name Vernaccia was used for other grapes such as the Sardinian grape used in Vernaccia di Oristano and the Marche grape. The origin of where it came from is still clouded in mystery and there are many disagreements of if it came from Eastern Europe, Greece or the Italian peninsula. Depending on the ripeness at harvest time, this grape can produce a wine that has fresh crispness, fresh, medium to full bodied with elegance and balance with a fine delicate bouquet of citrus and almond flowers with an almond finish.</p>

It wasn&rsquo;t until after World War two that the popularity for medium sweet rose arose. The demand rose and white wines lead to the creation of &ldquo;blush&rdquo; wines. &nbsp;Blush wines are made from red grapes in a technique called saignee. This process is where there is minimal skin contact which resulted in a stuck fermentation when the yeast dies before transforming the sugars to alcohol and leading to a sweeter wine. &nbsp;The term Blush was generally used only in North America and referred to color but since has been used worldwide as a reference for sweet rose. A majority of the dry Rose contains varietals like: Syrah, Grenache, and Carignan. Some of the regions known for a drier style of rose wines are regions such as Provence, Australia, and Languedoc.</span></p>

Geologically California has a broad range of climates with sufficient rainfall, cool winds, and well balance sunshine and heat. &nbsp;California&rsquo;s Mediterranean climate and diverse soil compositions make it easy to have a distinct variety of grapes to be grown. The wine regions are divided into four main regions which include: North Coast, Central Coast, South Coast, and Central valley. &nbsp;Over one hundred different varietals are grown in over 427,000 acres located on a stretch of land covering 700 miles. Producing everything from Sparkling wines, New World Wines, Old World Wines and even dessert wines, if California was a separate country, it would be the world&rsquo;s fourth largest wine producer. &nbsp;Some of the best quality wines come from California.</span></p>

When older vines are oak aged, it brings out the concentrated fruit, dense and tannic. &nbsp;Bonarda can be the same grape as Charbono found in California.

Sometimes labeled as a liqueuer, Absinthe has no added sugar and so the correct classification should be a Spirit. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span""> </span></span><span>Absinthe originated sometime in the 19th century in the Canton of Neuchantel, Switzerland although the use of wormwood as a medical use dates back to ancient Egypt and is mentioned as a remedy in Greece. &nbsp;It was actually very popular in France and associated with bohemians and artists such as Vincent Van Gogh. Other people who favored Absinthe were Oscar Wilde, Aleister Crowley, Henri de Toulouse- Lautrec and others. &nbsp;Absinthe was thought to be dangerously addictive and harmful because the wormwood used in absinthe contained thujone. Thujone causes seizures and hallucinations and can be fatal in high doses. Because of this research, Absinthe was banned in 1915 in the United States and most of Europe like France, Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. &nbsp;Absinthe is made from herbs which include flowers, anise, fennel, and artemisia absinthium (grand wormwood) where it derived its name. After further studies, it was concluded that the levels of thujone in Absinthe were over exaggerated and the revival of this popular drink began once again. In 1990, up to 200 brands of absinthe were being made throughout the world. &nbsp;It is now currently legal to sell Absinthe although the U.S. set a regulation that any Absinthe produced in the U.S. should be thujone free or less than 10mg/kg of thujone.</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Traditional ways to drink Absinthe</span></h2>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span> </span><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span""> </span></span><span>The French Way</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There is a ritual associated with drinking Absinthe which is to place a slotted spoon over a glass of Absinthe. &nbsp;A sugar cube is placed on the spoon and cold water is dripped on the sugar cube until it dissolves in the Absinthe. &nbsp;The green drink becomes cloudy and the herbal aromas and flavors blossom and bring out subtleties.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span> </span><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span""> </span></span><span>The Bohemian Way</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Similar to the French way with the exception that the sugar is soaked in Absinthe, set on fire and dropped into the Absinthe then a shot of water is added to douse the flames which produce a stronger drink.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Absinthe should never be put in the freezer due to the crystallization of some of the ingredients which form a scum on the inside of the bottle which dissolve back at room temperature and Absinthe should also be kept away from heat and light because the light breaks down the chlorophyll, changing the color from green to an ugly yellow.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It is still unknown what the long term effects of Absinthe are and although very controversial, Absinthe has a nice minty taste to it.</span></p>

Some say the name is based on the Italian word Amore meaning love and so this drink is sometimes associated with romance. &nbsp;Amaretto is widely known to be associated with the Saronno culture. One of the first Amarettos not to be confused with Amaro which is more bitter, was created in 1525 and has remained unchanged ever since. &nbsp;This secret formula contains an infusion of apricots, burnt sugar, herbs and absolute alcohol. The first Amaretto was named Amaretto di Saronno Originale which translates to Amaretto from Saronno but as time passed, it changed to Amaretto Disaronno which was packaged in a unique rectangular glass designed by a craftsman from Murano. &nbsp;Disaronno states that no nuts are included in their formula but other Amarettos might contain nuts. This beautiful drink is sometimes added to desserts like ice cream or cake. It actually pairs well with Tiramisu (a popular Italian cake). Served on the rocks or sometimes an ingredient in a mixed drink, Amaretto is a very popular drink. &nbsp;Similar to Irish cream, Amaretto is sometimes added to the morning cup of coffee. Included in many recipes like pancakes, added to meat sauces it adds a nice nutty flavor to chicken recipes. Very sweet and smooth with almond overtones on the palate, Amaretto is a favorite among many. </span></p>

Over the last 10 years, vodkas have increased their long list of flavors and while most flavors have been met with mixed reviews, the coffee is a definite winner. &nbsp;While Irish coffee and liquor added to coffee is still common for diners and restaurants, Coffee liquor is more popular in nightclubs. Among the popular brands are Van Gogh double espresso. This vodka is actually one of the FDA approved Vodkas. </span></p>
<p>Another great choice is the ever popular Patron XO which is coffee flavored tequila. &nbsp;Now I like many thought making a coffee flavored tequila is not the perfect match, but it definitely proved me wrong. &nbsp;One of the best ways to enjoy this is to put the bottle in the freezer and do shots when it is chilled. Most coffee liquors tend to be overly sweet but Patron has managed to capture the coffee flavor perfectly. &nbsp;It is even great poured over ice cream and with desserts.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So if you ever have the urge for a coffee with some kick, give these coffee flavored liqueurs a shot and enjoy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

The oils and sugar are added to pure alcohol and is bottled. &nbsp;The alcohol level is around 42% by volume. It is not clear where the word Sambuca comes from but some say it comes from an Arabic word Zammut which was the name of a drink discovered at the port of Civitavecchia. &nbsp;Others believe the word Sambuca comes from the Latin word Sambucus which means elderberry (a species of shrubs from the honeysuckle family). The first commercial introduction of this drink appeared at the end of 1800 where a man named Luigi Manzi started selling Sambuca Manzi, a product that is still produced today. &nbsp;After World War 2 Angelo Molinari started producing Sambuca. Extra Molinari was inspired by the success of Greek Ouzo in the 19th century. Sambuca can be enjoyed neat or as an Ammazzacaffe which means after coffee to dull the strong taste of the coffee. It can also be added to coffee as well and some people use it in baking and cooking. &nbsp;There are many brands on the market now with various prices.</span></span></p>

German Schnapps is clear and has a fruit flavor usually distilled from fermented fruit with no added sugar and has about 40% ABV (alcohol by volume). &nbsp;American schnapps is also a fruit flavored alcoholic beverage but usually contains sugar which is almost syrup like. Equivalent beverages exist all over Europe and are generally referred to as Rakia&rsquo;s. The French term for Schnapps is Eau de Vie although it is not really used. &nbsp;Some say that technically American liqueurs cannot be considered a Schnapp because it contains added sugar and some are not clear but it is still debatable. Some names of Schnapps are peppermint, peach, butterscotch, etc. </span></p>
